<p>Portland is projected to add 140,000 new jobs and 260,000 new residents over the next 20 years. As Portland and the region grow, however, there is a continuing challenge to maintain the natural environment, economic prosperity, and overall quality of life. If in 2035 the percentage of people who drive alone to work remains the same as it is now (nearly 60 percent), traffic, carbon emissions, and household spending on vehicles and fuel will all worsen significantly. In order to accommodate this growth, our transportation system must provide Portlanders safer and more convenient ways to walk, bike, and take transit for more trips. The 2035 Transportation System Plan guides investments to maintain and improve the livability of Portland by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>supporting the City’s commitment to Vision Zero by saving lives and reducing injuries to all people using our transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>limiting traffic congestion so transit and freight vehicles can move more reliably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reducing, carbon emissions and promoting healthy lifestyles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keeping more money in the local economy, as we spend less on vehicles and fuel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creating great places</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Transportation System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide transportation policies and investments in Portland. The TSP meets state and regional planning requirements and addresses local transportation needs. Transportation planning that promotes active transportation modes is essential to preserving the City’s livability and for the protection of the natural environment. Constructing significant amounts of new automobile capacity to accommodate growth is not a viable option because of the enormous costs and impacts. Adding more streets and parking lots divides neighborhoods, uses valuable land, encourages urban sprawl, and has negative environmental impacts. Alternative approaches, supporting a safer, more affordable and more complete multimodal transportation network must be used to ensure integrated, comprehensive solutions. The first TSP was adopted by Council in 2002 (Ordinance 177028).</p>
<p>The Transportation System Plan helps implement the City’s 2035 Comprehensive Plan in addition to the region’s 2040 Growth Concept by supporting a transportation system that makes it more convenient for people to walk, bicycle, use transit, and drive less to meet their daily needs. The TSP also recognizes that the transportation system must help grow and sustain the City’s economic health by accommodating the needs of businesses and supporting Portland’s role in the international economy.</p>
<p><strong>The 2035 TSP includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Goals and policies that guide the maintenance, development and implementation of Portland’s transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objectives that further the implementation of the goals and policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of projects and City wide programs along with a financial plan that would accommodate 20 years of population and employment growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master street plans and modal plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategies and regulations for implementation, including street classifications</p>

<h2 id="elements-of-the-tsp">Elements of the TSP</h2>
<p>The goals and policies, street classification descriptions and maps, the financial plan and the master street plan maps in the TSP were adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan by City Council in 2016. The TSP was adopted concurrently with the Comprehensive Plan, but published under a separate cover. Stage 3 Update will be adopted separately from the Comp Plan and Stages 1 and 2, then incorporated into one TSP document.</p>
<p>The TSP is both an implementation tool and a supporting document to the Comprehensive Plan. It contains the transportation element of the City’s Public Facilities Plan, and the List of Significant Projects and Citywide Programs. The TSP also provides more detail than the Comprehensive Plan by including additional supporting information about transportation system conditions.</p>

<h2 id="transportation-system-plan-updates">Transportation System Plan Updates</h2>
<p>In order to keep the TSP current and up-to-date with recent transportation planning and development activities, it is updated at regular intervals. The first two updates in the mid-2000s were not intended to include new policy initiatives. They were primarily technical in nature and included corrections, updates to project descriptions, updates on studies, and inclusion of new master street plans adopted as a part of planning efforts.</p>
<p>The first update was completed and adopted by City Council on October 13, 2004 (effective date, November 12, 2004; Ordinance Nos. 178815 and 178826).</p>
<p>The second update was completed and adopted by City Council on April 5, 2007 (effective date, May 5, 2007; Ordinance No 180871). While primarily technical in nature, this update also included new policy language to implement the City’s Green Street Policy.</p>
<p>Stage 1 TSP Update was a part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan update process and a component of the state’s Periodic Work Plan Task 4. It included Goals, Policies, Projects and Programs and a Financial Plan. It was adopted by City Council in June 2016.</p>
<p>The Stage 2 TSP Update was a part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan update and changes were made to implement the Comp Plan, as well as reflect adopted plans and classification changes since the last update in 2007. Periodic Work Plan Task 5 was adopted by City Council in December 2016.</p>
<p>TSP Stage 3 TSP Update is incorporating regional information, updating geographic policies and objectives, updating objectives, adding a few policies, changes to street classification for traffic, transit and emergency response, modal plans, and other changes as identified. There is also parallel staff process to reformat the document and create a new user friendly digital document.</p>
<h2 id="regulatory-framework">Regulatory Framework</h2>
<p>The TSP addresses and complies with a number of State and regional goals, policies, and regulations, as summarized below.</p>
<p>State of Oregon</p>
<p><em>Statewide Planning Goals</em></p>
<p>Oregon has 19 goals that provide a foundation for the State’s land use planning program. The TSP must comply with all applicable State goals. The two goals directly applicable to the TSP are Goal 11: Public Facilities Plan and Goal 12: Transportation.</p>
<p><em>Transportation Planning Rule</em></p>
<p>The Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) implements statewide planning Goal 12: Transportation. The TPR requires State, regional, and local jurisdictions to develop Transportation System Plans (TSPs) that comply with TPR provisions. These provisions include reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 10 percent over the next 20 years, reducing parking spaces per capita, and improving opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<p><em>Oregon Transportation Plan</em></p>
<p>The Oregon Transportation Plan (OTP) serves as the State’s TSP. Regional and local TSPs must be consistent with the OTP.</p>
<p>Regional Metro</p>
<p><em>Regional Transportation Plan</em></p>
<p>First adopted by Metro in 1983, with latest update in 2014, the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) serves as the regional TSP. As such, the RTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is consistent with the requirements of the State TPR and OTP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implements the 2040 Growth Concept and Regional Framework Plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focuses on the regional transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes multimodal functional classifications and street design classifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes a list of major system improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes a funding plan</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of August 2017 Metro and regional partners are updating the RTP with a new RTP to be issued in 2018.</p>
<p><em>Region 2040 Growth Concept</em></p>
<p>Metro adopted the 2040 Growth Concept as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. The 2040 Growth Concept stated the preferred form of long-term regional growth and development, including the urban growth boundary (UGB), density, and open space protection. It also designates design types, such as central city, regional center, town center, and main street.</p>
<p><em>Regional Transportation Functional Plan</em></p>
<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (first adopted in 2010, last updated in 2012; Ordinance No 10-1241B) implements the Goals and Objectives in section 2.3 of the RTP and the policies of the RTP, and replaces the regional parking policy of the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (See RTFP Title 4: Regional Parking Management.) It provides policy basis and direction for local TSPs. The RTFP codifies requirements that local plans must comply with to be consistent with the Regional Transportation Plan. Therefore, its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>
<p><em>Urban Growth Management Functional Plan</em></p>
<p>Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP) in 1996 and updated it 2014 to implement regional goals and objectives adopted by the Metro Council as the Regional Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGO), including the 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework Plan. The UGMFP addresses the accommodation of regional population and job growth. Its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>
<p><em>Regional Framework Plan</em></p>
<p>The Regional Framework Plan, adopted in 1997, identifies regional policies to implement the 2040 Growth Concept, preserving access to nature and building great communities for today and the future. The plan was amended in 2005 and 2010, and again in 2014 as part of the adoption of the Climate Smart Strategy.</p>
<p>City of Portland</p>

See the update of the Pedestrian Master Plan at https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/72504)</em></h2>
<p>Pedestrian Classification Descriptions maintain a system of pedestrianways to serve all types of pedestrian trips, particularly those with a transportation function.</p>
<h3 id="pedestrian-districts">Pedestrian Districts</h3>
<p>Pedestrian Districts are intended to give priority to pedestrian access in areas where high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned, including the Central City, Gateway regional center, town centers, and station communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Zoning should allow a transit-supportive density of residential and commercial uses that support lively and intensive pedestrian activity. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged in Pedestrian Districts. Institutional campuses that generate high levels of pedestrian activity may be included in Pedestrian Districts. Exceptions to the density and zoning criteria may be appropriate in some designated historic districts with a strong pedestrian orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Streets within a District:</strong> Make walking the mode of choice for all trips within a Pedestrian District. All streets within a Pedestrian District are equal in importance in serving pedestrian trips and should have sidewalks on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The size and configuration of a Pedestrian District should be consistent with the scale of walking trips. A Pedestrian District includes both sides of the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway. In these instances, the land up to the Regional Trafficway is considered part of the Pedestrian District, but the Regional Trafficway itself is not.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> A Pedestrian District should have, or be planned to have, frequent transit service and convenient access to transit stops.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design streets within Pedestrian Districts. Improvements may include widened sidewalks, curb extensions, street lighting, street trees, and signing. Where two arterials cross, design treatments such as curb extensions, median pedestrian refuges, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals should be considered to minimize the crossing distance, direct pedestrians across the safest route, and provide safe gaps in the traffic stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="pedestrian-transit-streets">Pedestrian-Transit Streets</h3>
<p>Pedestrian-Transit Streets are intended to create a strong and visible relationship between pedestrians and transit within the Central City.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Pedestrian-Transit Streets respond to significant public investments in public transportation, including light rail, the transit mall, and streetcar, and enhance the pedestrian environment adjacent to high-density land uses.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Improvements should include wide sidewalks to accommodate high levels of pedestrian traffic, urban design features that promote pedestrian activity, and visual signals to motor vehicles to recognize the priority of pedestrian and transit vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="city-walkways">City Walkways</h3>
<p>City Walkways are intended to provide safe, convenient, and attractive pedestrian access to activities along major streets and to recreation and institutions; provide connections between neighborhoods; and provide access to transit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> City Walkways should serve areas with dense zoning, commercial areas, and major destinations. Where auto-oriented land uses are allowed on City Walkways, site development standards should address the needs of pedestrians for access.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design City Walkways. Consider special design treatment for City Walkways that are also designated as Regional or Community Main Streets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="off-street-paths">Off-Street Paths</h3>
<p>Off-Street Paths are intended to serve recreational and other walking trips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Use Off-Street Paths as shortcuts to link urban destinations and origins along continuous greenbelts such as rivers, park and forest areas, and other scenic corridors, and used as elements of a regional, citywide, or community recreational trail plan.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Establish Off-Street Paths in corridors not well served by the street system. On existing rights-of-way that are not developed or likely to be developed in the near future, Off-Street Paths may be designated where needed to complete the pedestrian system.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Off-Street Paths. Design Off-Street Paths as separated facilities that accommodate pedestrians and may accommodate other non-motorized vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-walkways">Local Service Walkways</h3>
<p>Local Service Walkways are intended to serve local circulation needs for pedestrians and provide safe and convenient access to local destinations, including safe routes to schools.</p>

<p>Major City Bikeways form the backbone of the city’s bikeway network and are intended to serve high volumes of bicycle traffic and provide direct, seamless, efficient travel across and between transportation districts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Major City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Major City Bikeways should be designed to accommodate large volumes of bicyclists, to maximize their comfort and to minimize delays by emphasizing the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on Major City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after performing careful analysis to determine potential impacts to the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On Major City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines. Where conditions warrant and where practical, Major City Bikeways should have separated facilities for bicycles and pedestrians.</p>

<h2 id="transit-classification-descriptions">Transit Classification Descriptions</h2>
<p>Maintain a system of transit streets that supports the movement of transit vehicles for regional, interdistrict, and local trips.</p>
<h3 id="regional-transitways">Regional Transitways</h3>
<p>Regional Transitways are intended to facilitate regional and interdistrict transit trips with fast and reliable service over long distances, operating in right-of-way exclusively reserved for transit use to the extent possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Development with a regional attraction (e.g., shopping centers, arenas) are encouraged to locate adjacent to Regional Transitway stations to reduce traffic impacts on adjoining areas and streets. Locate high-density development within a half-mile of transit stations on Regional Transitways, with the highest densities closest to the stations.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> Transit stations should be designed to accommodate a high level of safe multimodal access within a half-mile radius of the station. Provide convenient connection opportunities at Regional Transitway stations when feasible, including feeder bus service, bike-share stations, secure bicycle parking, pick-up and drop-off zones, and shuttle services. Use park-and-ride facilities to access Regional Transit stations only at ends of Regional Transitways or where adequate feeder bus service is not feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use transit-preferential treatments to facilitate fast and reliable transit operations. Provide signal preemption or transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stations or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Provide exclusive or semi-exclusive transitways wherever possible, including treatments on freeways and expressways such as transit lanes, HOV lanes, HOT lanes, and “bus on shoulder” operations. Employ access management measures to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles. Right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures and improve access to transit. Carefully consider any street design changes to Regional Transitways that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.</p>
<p><strong>Transit Stations:</strong> Locate Regional Transitway stations at intervals of approximately one-half mile to two miles, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points, and people with disabilities. Express or limited service may have stations located further apart, as appropriate to serve origins and destinations. Transit stations should have a full range of passenger services, including accessible boarding platforms, covered waiting areas, route information, benches, secure bicycle parking, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.<br>
<br>
<strong>Bus stops:</strong> Buses providing local service along Regional Transitways should have more frequent stop spacing, similar to stop spacing along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> A street with a dual Regional Transitway and Major Transit Priority Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major Transit Priority Street and respond to adjacent land uses.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> A ramp that connects to a Regional Transitway is classified as a Regional Transitway up to its intersection with a lower-classified street.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="major-transit-priority-streets">Major Transit Priority Streets</h3>
<p>Major Transit Priority Streets facilitate the frequent and reliable movement of transit vehicles that connect Central City, regional centers, and town centers with each other and to other major destinations. Major Transit Priority Streets are provided frequent service, or are expected to receive that level of service in the future to support envisioned growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Transit-oriented land uses should be encouraged to locate along Major Transit Priority Streets, especially in centers. Discourage auto-oriented develop­ment from locating on a Major Transit Priority Street, except where the street is outside the Central City, center, station community, or main street and is also classified as a Major City Traffic Street. Support land use densi­ties that vary directly with the existing and planned capacity of transit service.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> Provide safe and convenient access for pedestrians and bicyclists to, across, and along Major Transit Priority Streets. Provide safe and accessible pedestrian crossings at all transit stops along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Provide transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stops or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Consider the use of exclusive or semi-exclusive transit lanes where needed to reduce congestion-related transit delay. Design intersections of Major Transit Priority Streets with other Major Transit Priority Streets or Transit Access Streets to allow turning movements of a standard transit vehicle. Where compatible with adjacent land use designations, right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures or improve access to transit. The use of access manage­ment should be considered where needed to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles.Carefully consider any street design changes to Major Transit Priority Streets that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Major Transit Priority Streets are not eligible for new traffic slowing devices such as speed bumps or speed cushions. Existing traffic slowing devices on Major Transit Priority Streets may remain and may be maintained and replaced as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer Points:</strong> Provide safe and convenient transfer points with accessible stops, covered waiting areas, transit route information, benches, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Stops:</strong> Locate bus stops to provide convenient access to neighborhoods and commercial centers. Stops should be located roughly every one-quarter to one-half mile, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points and people with disabilities. Stop spacing should also take into account existing sidewalk and street connectivity, with potentially closer stop spacing where sidewalk and street connectivity is more limited. On-street parking should be prohibited at bus stops in order to provide accessible waiting areas. Passenger amenities should include shelters and route information.</p>

<p>Street Design Classification Descriptions provide general design guidance based on the current and planned land use context around the street. Whenever possible, a “complete streets” approach should be taken during street design to accommodate all necessary modes and functions, taking into account the modal classifications. Where right-of-way is limited and tradeoffs must be made, refer to the modal street classifications as well as the Transportation Strategy for People Movement (Policy 9.6) to help guide decision-making regarding allocation of right-of-way. If one or more modes are still unable to be accommodated in the available right-of-way, a “complete networks” approach should be used to ensure that those modes are still accommodated on parallel routes as a part of project design.</p>

<p><strong>Design Elements:</strong> Urban Throughway design typically includes vehicle lanes, grade-separated or signalized pedestrian and bicycle, parallel pathways or separated facilities for pedestrian and bicycle travel, clear sightlines, median barriers, shoulders, and motor vehicle lane widths that accommodate freight movement. Where appropriate, transit priority treatments should be used to enhance transit speed and reliability. Encourage the Oregon Department of Transportation to maintain a continuous landscape along Urban Throughways that reduces the visual impacts of the throughway on motorists and adjacent land uses.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> A ramp that connects to an Urban Throughway is classified as an Urban Throughway up to its intersection with a differently-classified street. An interchange between an Urban Throughway and a differently-classified street should be designed to safely accommodate all modes and provide the least possible disruption to the surrounding modal networks. Connections should be provided across Urban Throughways at closely-spaced intervals to provide greater street connectivity.</p>

<h3 id="industrial-roads">Industrial Roads</h3>
<p>Industrial Roads are designed to emphasize freight mobility while also accommodating other modes and providing local access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Industrial Roads typically serve industrial areas and freight intermodal sites, with a significant percentage of trips being made by trucks. Adjacent land uses sometimes orient to the Industrial Road.</p>
<p><strong>Lanes:</strong> Industrial Road design typically includes two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed. Dedicated freight-only lanes or turn pockets may be provided as needed to support roadway efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Industrial Roads emphasize freight mobility while accommodating other modes and providing access to industrial sites and freight districts.</p>
<p><strong>Curb zone:</strong> The curb zone along Industrial Roads primarily serves mobility functions such as vehicle lanes or bike lanes. The curb zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading at limited locations if needed to support adjacent land use.</p>
<p><strong>Separation:</strong> Industrial Roads have limited street connections that may occur at the same grade or separate grades. Pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be grade-separated or signalized, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Design Elements:</strong> Industrial Road design typically includes vehicle lanes, medians or center turn lanes where needed, limited driveway access, pullouts for bus stops, transit priority treatments, separated pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and improved pedestrian crossings located on overpasses, underpasses, or signalized at-grade intersections. Industrial Roads may also include design treatments that improve freight mobility, such as freight-only lanes, freight signal priority, and a wider turning radius at intersections.</p>

<h3 id="enhanced-greenway-corridors">Enhanced Greenway Corridors</h3>
<p>Enhanced Greenway Corridors are designed to provide a network of scenic low-stress connections that prioritize walking and/or bicycling and often include natural features as well as innovative urban design and place-making elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> Streets may have an Enhanced Greenway Corridor classification in addition to another street design classification. When developing or retrofitting these streets, incorporate Enhanced Greenway Corridor design elements within the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Enhanced Greenway Corridors connect parks, open spaces, and singular attractions throughout the City to each other and to surrounding neighborhoods via a network of scenic and low-stress walking and/or bicycling routes. They can run through a variety of different land use contexts, including residential neighborhoods, natural areas, industrial areas, and employment centers.</p>
<p><strong>Design Elements:</strong> Enhanced Greenway Corridor design can take many forms, and should use flexible design treatments appropriate to adjacent land use context. Design elements may include: neighborhood greenways; traffic calming; motor vehicle diversion; multi-use paths; wide sidewalks; boardwalks; trails; separated bikeways; broad-canopy trees and landscaping; scenic views; stormwater management; underground utilities; special lighting; and way-finding. Where appropriate, pedestrian and bicycle routes may use separate parallel routes or streets along a corridor.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="greenscape-streets">Greenscape Streets</h3>
<p>Greenscape Street designs are applied to arterials where natural or informal landscapes dominate the adjacent areas and the right-of-way, such as lower-density residential areas in wooded settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> Where streets have a Greenscape Street design designation and another street design designation, consider the natural characteristics of the street during the design and implementation of street improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Design Treatment:</strong> During improvement projects, consider the use of vegetated stormwater treatment techniques; minimizing impervious surfaces; preservation of existing vegetation, topography, vistas and viewpoints, driver perception, street lighting, and sight distance requirements. Vegetation may be landscaped or native, depending on the existing and desired character.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-streets">Local Streets</h3>
<p>Local Streets are designed to complement planned land uses and reduce dependence on arterials for local circulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Local Streets are multimodal, but are not intended for trucks (other than local deliveries) in residential areas. Local Streets are important for local circulation of trucks in commercial and industrial areas.</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> Local Street design typically includes frequent street connections, sidewalks, on-street parking, stormwater facilities, and planting of street trees and ground covers (where planting strips are included). A shared street design without sidewalks may be appropriate where traffic volumes are sufficiently low.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as Urban Throughways, Urban Highways, Industrial Roads, Civic Main Streets, Neighborhood Main Streets, Civic Corridors, Neighborhood Corridors, Regional Corridors, or Community Corridors are classified as Local Streets for street design.</p>

<p>Emergency Response Streets are intended to provide a network of streets to facilitate prompt emergency response.</p>
<h3 id="major-emergency-response-streets">Major Emergency Response Streets</h3>
<p>Major Emergency Response Streets are intended to serve primarily the longer, most direct legs of emergency response trips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Design treatments on Major Emergency Response Streets should enhance mobility for emergency response vehicles by employing preferential or priority treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Major Emergency Response Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for speed cushions, subject to the approval of Portland Fire and Rescue. Major Emergency Response Streets that also have a District Collector or higher traffic classification are not eligible for traffic slowing devices in the future. Existing speed bumps on Major Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications, subject to the approval of Portland Fire and Rescue. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="secondary-emergency-response-streets">Secondary Emergency Response Streets</h3>
<p>Secondary Emergency Response Streets are intended to provide alternatives to Major Emergency Response Streets in cases when traffic congestion, construction, or other events occur that may cause undue delays in response times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Design treatments on Secondary Emergency Response Streets should enhance mobility for emergency response vehicles by employing preferential or priority treatments, while also allowing for limited traffic slowing treatments to enhance safety and livability.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Secondary Emergency Response Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for speed cushions. Secondary Emergency Response Streets that also have a District Collector or higher traffic classification are not eligible for traffic slowing devices in the future. Existing speed bumps on Secondary Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.</p>

<h3 id="minor-emergency-response-streets">Minor Emergency Response Streets</h3>
<p>Minor Emergency Response Streets are intended to serve primarily the shorter legs of emergency response trips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as Major Emergency Response Streets or Secondary Emergency Response Streets are classified as Minor Emergency Response Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Design and operate Minor Emergency Response Streets to allow access to individual properties by emergency response vehicles, but maintain livability on the street.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Minor Emergency Response Streets are eligible for all types of traffic slowing devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="traffic-classification-descriptions">Traffic Classification Descriptions</h2>
<p>Maintain a system of traffic streets that support the movement of motor vehicles for regional, city, district, neighborhood, and local trips. For each type of traffic classification, the majority of motor vehicle trips on a street should conform to its classification description.</p>
<h3 id="regional-trafficways">Regional Trafficways</h3>
<p>Regional Trafficways are intended to serve regional traffic movement that has only one trip end in a City of Portland transportation district or to serve trips that bypass a district completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Regional Trafficways should make safety the highest priority. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Regional Trafficways to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Regional Trafficways should serve the Central City, regional centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities and should connect key freight routes within the region to points outside the region.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Regional Trafficways should connect to other Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, and District Collectors. A ramp that connects to a Regional Trafficway is classified as a Regional Trafficway from its point of connection up to its intersection with a lower-classified street. At ramps and along access streets, accommodate safe multimodal movements.</p>
<p><strong>Buffering:</strong> Adjacent neighborhoods should be buffered from the impacts of Regional Trafficways.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> A street with dual Regional Trafficway and Major City Traffic Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major City Traffic Street and respond to adjacent land uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="major-city-traffic-streets">Major City Traffic Streets</h3>
<p>Major City Traffic Streets are intended to serve as the principal routes for interdistrict traffic that has at least one trip end within a City of Portland transportation district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Major City Traffic Streets. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Major City Traffic Streets to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes for all modes. Major City Traffic Streets should provide separation between motor vehicles and people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices, and provide safe multimodal crossings to destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Major City Traffic Streets should provide motor vehicle connections among the Central City, regional centers, town centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Auto-oriented development should locate adjacent to Major City Traffic Streets, except within designated centers, main streets, station areas, and other areas with high pedestrian demand.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Major City Traffic Streets should serve as primary connections to Regional Trafficways and serve major activity centers in each district. Traffic with no trip ends within a City of Portland transportation district should be discouraged from using Major City Traffic Streets. Where a Major City Traffic Street intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>On-Street Parking:</strong> On-street parking may be removed and additional right-of-way purchased to provide adequate traffic access when consistent with the street design designation of the street. Evaluate the need for on-street parking to serve adjacent land uses and improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists when making changes to the roadway.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="traffic-access-streets">Traffic Access Streets</h3>
<p>Traffic Access Streets are intended to provide access to Central City destinations, distribute traffic within a Central City sub-district, provide connections between Central City subdistricts, and distribute traffic from Regional Trafficways and Major City Traffic Streets for access within the district. Traffic Access Streets are not intended for through-traffic with no trip ends in the district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Traffic Access Streets. Traffic Access Streets should provide frequent, safe crossings for people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Traffic Access Streets serve Central City land uses. Traffic management on Traffic Access Streets must accommodate the high-density pattern desired in the Central City.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Connections to adjoining transportation districts should be to District or Neighborhood Collectors. Intersections of Traffic Access Streets and other streets with higher or similar classifications should be signalized, where warranted, to facilitate the safe movement of traffic along each street as well as turning movements from one street to the other.</p>
<p><strong>Access:</strong> Reduction in motor vehicle congestion is given less priority than: supporting pedestrian access and enhancing the pedestrian environment; maintaining on-street parking to support land uses; accommodating transit; or accommodating bicycles. Access to off-street parking is allowed and encouraged to be located on Traffic Access Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Traffic Access Streets, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="district-collectors">District Collectors</h3>
<p>District Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets to streets of the same or lower classification or to serve trips that both start and end within a district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on District Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be employed to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> District Collectors generally connect town centers, corridors, main streets, and neighborhoods to nearby regional centers and other major destinations. Land uses that attract trips from the surrounding neighbor­hoods or from throughout the district should be encouraged to locate on District Collectors. Regional attractors of traffic such as major shopping centers or arenas should be discouraged from locating on District Collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> District Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, other collectors, and local streets and, where necessary, to Regional Trafficways. Where a District Collector intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on District Collectors, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="neighborhood-collectors">Neighborhood Collectors</h3>
<p>Neighborhood Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets or District Collectors to Local Service Streets or to serve trips that both start and end within areas bounded by Major City Traffic Streets and District Collectors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Neighborhood Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be implemented on Neighborhood Collectors to address identified safety risks. Neighborhood Collectors should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Neighborhood Collectors should connect neighborhoods to nearby centers, corridors, station communities, main streets, and other nearby destinations. New land uses and major expansions of land uses that attract a significant volume of traffic from outside the neighborhood should be discour­aged from locating on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Neighborhood Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, and other Neighborhood Collectors, as well as to Local Service Streets. Where a Neighborhood Collector intersects with a higher-classified street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Calming:</strong> Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability, when consistent with other street classifications.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> The design of Neighborhood Collectors may vary over their length as the land use character changes from primarily commercial to primarily residential. All Neighborhood Collectors should be designed to operate as neighborhood streets and through traffic should be discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-traffic-streets">Local Service Traffic Streets</h3>
<p>Local Service Traffic Streets are intended to distribute local traffic and provide access to local residences or commercial uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Discourage auto-oriented land uses from using Local Service Traffic Streets as their primary access.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Streets that allow motor vehicles and are not classified as Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, Traffic Access Streets**,** District Collectors, or Neighborhood Collectors are classified as Local Service Traffic Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets should connect neighborhoods, provide local circulation, and provide access to nearby centers, corridors, station areas, and main streets. Street segments may be closed to through traffic in some cases as long as local access and overall neighborhood connectivity is maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Calming:</strong> Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability or if needed to support a neighborhood greenway.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets provide local access and circulation for traffic, while often functioning as through routes for pedestrians and bicyclists. In some instances where vehicle speeds and volumes are very low, Local Service Traffic Streets may accommodate vehicles**,** pedestrians**,** and bicyclists in a shared space.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="master-street-plans">Master Street Plans</h1>
<p>The purpose of the Master Street Plans is to increase the efficiency of the transportation system through increased street connectivity and a finer mesh of pedestrian and bikeways. A dense grid of streets helps spread local vehicle trips more evenly over the local street network and reduces congestion on the arterial system. Studies show that improved local street connectivity improves arterial system capacity by as much as 25 percent.</p>
<p>Studies show that distance is one of the most important factors in mode choice. The lack of a dense grid of streets and pedestrian/bicycle connections results in out-of-direction travel that is particularly discouraging to potential pedestrians and bicyclists. The result is increased use of the automobile for trips to nearby (as the crow flies) destinations. Trips need to be relatively short and direct to encourage travel on foot or by bicycle.</p>
<p>Good street connectivity improves emergency response times. Police, fire, and ambulance services can reach their destinations more quickly because there is less out-of-direction travel. Multiple access routes can reduce travel times and provide access options if one route is blocked.</p>
<p>Good local street connections can reduce traffic volumes on other streets by spreading traffic over a denser network. With more intersections, traffic also moves more slowly because side street traffic and stop signs discourage drivers from speeding.</p>
<p>As properties are subdivided and developed, access needs are met primarily through new streets. The City’s local street network has grown over time, as outlying areas became more urbanized or older areas are redeveloped. In the past, development was not always required to address connections to adjacent areas as well as internal circulation. The result has been large areas of the City with poor connectivity, particularly in newer areas where the counties previously regulated development.</p>
<p><strong>State Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Street connectivity must be part of transportation system plans (TSPs) and adopting Ordinances. The Oregon Administrative Rule for State Land Use Goal 12, Transportation, Section 660-012-0020, Elements of Transportation Systems Plans, requires:</p>
<p>A road plan for a system of arterials and collectors and standards for the layout of local streets and other important non-collector street connections… The standards for the layout of local streets shall provide for safe and convenient bike and pedestrian circulation necessary to carry out OAR 660-012-045(3)(b).</p>
<p>The State Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) states that the intent of the requirement is to provide guidance on the spacing of future extensions and connections along existing and future streets that are needed to provide reasonably direct routes for bicycle and pedestrian travel.
The rule referenced above goes on to state:</p>
<p>On-site facilities shall be provided which accommodate safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access from within new subdivisions, multi-family developments, planned developments, shopping centers, and commercial districts to adjacent residential areas and transit stops, and to neighborhood activity centers within one-half mile of the development. Single-family residential developments shall generally include streets and accessways. Pedestrian circulation through parking lots should generally be provided in the form of accessways.</p>
<p>The TPR also states that local jurisdictions should establish their own standards or criteria for providing streets and accessways consistent with the intent stated above. This may be accomplished through standards for spacing of streets or accessways, and standards for excessive out-of-direction travel. The TPR defines ‘safe and convenient’ access as being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reasonably free from hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting the needs of cyclists and pedestrians, considering destination and length of trip</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metro Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (RTFP), adopted in 2010 (Ordinance 10-1241B) and updated in 2012, requires jurisdictions to implement two types of street plans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conceptual street plans that:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Map contiguous areas of vacant and redevelopable parcels of five or more acres planned or zoned for residential or mixed-use development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify appropriate connections to adjacent areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate opportunities to extend and connect to existing streets, provide direct public right-of-way routes, and limit the potential of cul-de-sac and other closed-end street designs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>A street map for new residential or mixed-use development that will require construction of a new street(s) that:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Responds to and expands on the conceptual street plan map</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides for street connections no further apart than 530 feet, except where prevented by barriers such as topography, railroads, freeways, pre-existing development, or water features where regulations do not allow construction of or prescribe different standards for streets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides bicycle and/or pedestrian connections when full street connections are not possible, no further apart than 330 feet, except where prevented by barriers as noted above</p>

<h4 id="south-waterfront-district-street-plan-criteria-and-standards">South Waterfront District Street Plan, Criteria, and Standards</h4>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>In 1996, the Portland City Council accepted the City Engineer’s Report titled North Macadam District Street Plan, which identified and classified a street system for the North Macadam District. On January 20, 2003, City Council adopted amendments to the Central City Plan and updated the District’s special design guidelines and the zoning code. At the same time, City Council changed the North Macadam District name to South Waterfront District (the District). By authority of the City Engineer under Title 17 City Code, the South Waterfront Street Plan, Criteria and Standards was amended in 2007 providing updated design criteria and standard details for the District’s public rights-of-way. The 2009 document update amends the North District (the area south of Sheridan St and north of Gibbs St) rights-of-way alignment and standards to accommodate future light rail and property development, as well as expanded streetcar service and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
<p>The South Waterfront District of the Central City of Portland lies along the Willamette River and south of downtown. The district boundaries are the River, Interstate 5, the Marquam Bridge and SW Hamilton Court. Adopted City policy envisions this as a mixed-use neighborhood with significant residential development along the River and commercial development focused along transit corridors. With just over one mile of River frontage the District contains approximately 140 acres. Some land is developed or being developed and some land is vacant land or has redevelopment potential.</p>
<p>The primary development constraint in the District is transportation access to and from regional highway and transit systems. The South Waterfront Plan of January 20, 2003 includes a vision, policies and an Urban Design Plan that promotes high density housing and commercial development with a full range of businesses that contribute to the region’s job growth. The vision also includes frequent public connections to the river, limiting the size and amount of surface parking lots, and integrating development and services.</p>
<p><img src="/img/media/image8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In 1998 the North Macadam District Street Design Standards and Criteria Plan: Transportation Report considered and analyzed South Waterfront’s limited access and adjacency to I-5 and Ross Island Bridge ramps. The analysis included the three district portal intersections: River Parkway and Harbor Drive (north), Curry and Macadam (center) and Bancroft and Macadam (south). The analysis was based on the District’s 20-year goals for accommodating 10,000 jobs and 3,000 housing units and a 30 percent mode split. The housing goal has since been increased to 5,000 units.</p>
<p>Conclusions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bancroft and Macadam portal improvements would accommodate traffic growth and transit access at acceptable levels of service. South Waterfront (North Macadam District) became part of the Central City in 1988.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving the central portal from Gibbs to Curry and improving the Curry and Macadam intersection would better accommodate traffic operation, growth and access from I-5 to the District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the District’s growth nears 10,000 jobs and 5,000 housing units, portal access will degrade and as a result function at a marginally acceptable level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>River Parkway and Harbor Drive would operate at acceptable levels although backups on I-5 and Naito Parkway could interfere with operations on a more frequent basis in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 1998 transportation analysis demonstrated that while the District will experience increased congestion over time, the portal capacity with the identified portal improvements and increased transit service should continue to provide acceptable levels of service to the District and the regional transportation system.</p>
<p>Since the 1998 report, plans for portal improvements have been altered. Through the South Portal Study, conducted in 2006, the recommended south portal shifted south to Hamilton St and Macadam. In addition, the planned central portal improvements at Curry have been scaled back and north portal improvements at River Parkway and Harbor Drive have been added. In fact, in 2009 the Portland Bureau of Transportation updated the technical analysis through the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy (resolution no. 36696 adopted April 8, 2009). The report identified multi-modal project priorities and a funding strategy to guide project implementation necessary to support continued development of the urban renewal area, including portal improvements.</p>
<p>The 2007 update of the South Waterfront District Street Plan, Criteria and Standards primarily responded to development in the Central District and completion of infrastructure projects, including the Portland Streetcar extension to Lowell St and the Portland Aerial Tram to Oregon Health Sciences University. Transportation studies, such as the 2004 South Waterfront District Transportation Improvements Evaluation and 2006 South Portal Study had also been completed. Major updates included changes to the street lighting design standards, certain street furniture standards, and the modification of the street plan based on the recommendations of the South Portal Study and the new Greenstreet Policy (Resolution no. 36500 adopted in April of 2007). Other changes included modest refinements to various street dimensional standards developed through preliminary engineering and construction of these streets and to refinements of various performance criteria.</p>
<p><strong>South Waterfront 2009 Update</strong></p>
<p>Since the 2007 update, the City of Portland has endorsed the Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA) for the Portland to Milwaukie Light Rail alignment. This alignment extended light rail south into the North District and included bus service and streetcar utilizing the same alignment. In addition, the OHSU Schnitzer Campus master plan and the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy report, with a prioritized list of multi-modal projects and a funding strategy, have been completed. These activities generated the need to refine and update various elements of the Street Plan. Major updates include changes to the street alignments and designations in the Concept Street Plan Map, updates of some street widths in the Right-of-Way Width Map changes to street descriptions in the Street Classification and Function Table, and adjustments to the Standard Street Sections.</p>
<p>Specific changes made to the Concept Street Plan map are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bond Ave extends north through the District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bond Ave is one-way northbound through the District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moody Ave is one-way southbound for vehicular traffic through the District; and one-way southbound for streetcar south of Woods St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moody Ave remains two-way streetcar north of Woods St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moody Ave includes a two-way bike path along the west-side to minimize bike/streetcar interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grades of Moody Ave and Porter St are raised to a level consistent with the Willamette River Crossing Partnership findings necessary for light rail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Porter St carries light rail, streetcar and bus in two directions only; private vehicles are not accommodated on this street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>River Pkwy (south of the Marquam Bridge) terminates at Woods St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alignments are adjusted for local east-west streets north of Gibbs St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Special Design Area” beneath the Ross Island Bridge has been relocated to reflect the location of the potential active-use park. Grover St is aligned on either side of the Ross Island Bridge.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gateway-regional-center-street-plan">Gateway Regional Center Street Plan</h4>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The 2040 Growth Concept identifies the Gateway regional center as the only regional center in Portland. Planning for Gateway began with the Outer Southeast Community Plan and continued with the Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy. City Council accepted Opportunity Gateway in February 2000 (Resolution No. 35867). The Outer Southeast Community Plan resulted in a plan district and transit-supportive zoning</p>
<p>The Central Gateway portion of the Gateway District Master Street Plan was amended in 2009. This amendment was based on a recommendation in the Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy, which was adopted by the Portland Development Commission in August 2007. The Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy concluded that the street plan for Central Gateway should be updated, with the goal of increasing connectivity in Central Gateway, providing greater certainty to developers about street requirements and opening up parcels to redevelopment.</p>
<p><strong>Street Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>A discontinuous network of streets and sidewalks, high volumes of through-traffic, and underutilized property characterize Gateway regional center. Access to the transit stations in Gateway’s northwest corner and at 102^nd^ and Burnside is problematic. Discontinuous streets discourage walking and bicycling, resulting in significant out-of-direction travel for all modes.</p>
<p>Increasing street connectivity would disperse trips among many alternate routes, thereby reducing congestion, shortening trip lengths, and increasing the mode split for alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<p><strong>Concept Plan Map</strong></p>
<p>The Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy is intended to serve as the ‘appropriate vision’ for the redevelopment of Gateway as a regional center. The concept plan map is a picture of the regional center’s redevelopment potential and build-out in 2019. While the plan map affixes buildings and parks to specific locations, the reality is that new construction will appear somewhat differently. While new streets and connections are identified, they are also subject to change to respond to development opportunities. The Opportunity Gateway report states: “It is rigid enough to be a statement of what is and is not desirable in the Regional Center, and flexible enough to be useful even as redevelopment circumstances change.” The map graphically depicts the vision described in the report.</p>
<p>The concept plan map calls for a traditional block configuration, which will help unify the regional center’s character. Some of the proposed new connections would greatly change existing circulation patterns. Northeast Multnomah between Fred Meyer’s and Mervyn’s at the Gateway Shopping Center is shown as a fully functional street, intended to help disperse traffic associated with the transit center. In the southern part of the regional center, several new public streets are shown in the Mall 205 and Plaza 205 properties, breaking up what are now large expanses of parking. Pedestrian pathways connect important routes and destinations where full streets are not possible or appropriate, such as between SE 105^th^ and the Adventist Medical Center.</p>
<p>As the major north-south arterial, 102^nd^ Avenue is the spine of the district and is targeted for improvements for all modes. Changes to 99^th^ Avenue would allow it to act as an additional north-south carrier, improving access for development projects and creating a new local identity the length of the district. Major east-west streets (Stark/Washington, Halsey/Weidler, Burnside, and Glisan) will continue to carry significant volumes of through-traffic. Better local north-south street connections will link the two main large shopping areas together, and improved connectivity will be provided within each of these shopping areas.</p>
<p><strong>Central Gateway Street Plan 2009</strong></p>
<p>The Central Gateway Master Street Plan revision was developed to provide flexibility for connections while maintaining larger parcels for redevelopment, recognizing existing parcel lines, provide connections on the local network without altering the district or neighborhood collectors and to foster redevelopment in the City’s only Regional Center. Criteria were established for consideration in the proposed plan. Other goals of the plan included aligning streets on parcel boundaries for shared investment in right-of-way improvements; consider common or multiple parcel ownership; minimize parcel impacts and maintain reminder parcels; preserve some large parcels or contiguous ownership parcels; discourage cut-through traffic while providing access; discourage off-set intersections; consider potential spacing of crosswalks or signals.</p>
<p>With these criteria and goals, a revised street plan for Central Gateway was developed. The revised street plan provided needed multi-modal connections within the Central Gateway area without changing the function of the major traffic streets and collectors surrounding the area, such as 102nd Ave., Glisan, Burnside, and Stark.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the revised street plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>East-west connections between 97th Ave. and 102nd Ave. on Flanders St. and Davis St. North-south connection on 100th Ave. between Oak St. and Burnside and also between Oregon St. and Pacific St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>North–south connection on 101st Ave. between Stark St. and approximately Flanders St., improving multi-modal access to the light-rail station on 102nd and Burnside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal connection on Oregon St. approximately Hoyt St., Coach St., and 101st Ave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vacating portions of 97th Ave. to allow developable parcels near I-205. This would continue to allow multi-modal access to the parcels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining existing large parcels for development and redevelopment while also providing public bicycle and pedestrian access ways. Large parcels would have the option to have public bike and pedestrian access ways on the site rather than full streets, as was required in the prior master street plan. Public bike and pedestrian access ways will be required on certain blocks such that spacing of public connections shall be no more than 330 feet where full street connections are more than 530 feet. Additionally, pedestrian connections would be required throughout Central Gateway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because large parcels were maintained for development and redevelopment, the revised street plan does not include some of the proposed streets that were in the previous in the street plan for the Gateway District. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extension of Oregon St. between 97th Ave. and 98th Ave. However, the revised street plan proposes to keep the Irving St. alignment as existing between 97th Ave. and 100th Ave., whereas the prior plan showed this segment as vacated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full street connection of Hoyt St. between 97th Ave. and 104th Ave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full street connection of roughly the Davis St. alignment between 97th Ave. and 103rd Ave. The revised street plan proposes that some portions of the alignment would be full street while other portions would be pedestrian connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extension of 101st Ave. between Washington St. and Pacific St. The revised street plan proposes a mix of full streets and pedestrian connections on some portions of the 101st Ave. alignment. Other portions of the alignment would not have connections. Unlike as in the prior plan, the revised street plan does not intend for 101st Ave. to become a neighborhood collector. Rather, 99th Ave. would be a through street, with 100th Ave. also providing significant connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extension of 100th Ave. between Oak St. and Washington St. The revised street plan does not include any connectivity at this location. Vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles could access the area from connections at 97th Ave., and 101st.</p>
</li>

<h4 id="cully-neighborhood-local-street-plan-2012">Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan (2012)</h4>
<p>The Cully Commercial Corridor and Local Street Plan was adopted by Resolution 36952 in August 2012. Its development was funded by a Transportation Growth Management Grant from the Oregon Department of Transportation. Its recommendations were also influenced by the Portland Plan (April 2012) which had recommendations related to alternative right-of-way improvements, developing new options for unimproved rights-of-way and accelerating the creation of safe pedestrian connections. The Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan identified new street or pedestrian/bicycle connections to improve street connectivity and address gaps in transportation networks.</p>

<h4 id="southwest-and-far-southeast">Southwest and Far Southeast</h4>
<p>The City completed master street plans for the Southwest and Far Southeast transportation districts in June 2001. These two master street plans satisfy the State and regional requirements to identify the location and type of new local street connections. The methodology and criteria used to develop the plans are described briefly below. The SW and Far SE Master Street Plan – Final Report and Recommendations contains quarter-section level maps and tables that detail the recommended connections. The report identifies three objectives to be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduce the uncertainty in the development review process regarding when and where new street connections will be an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for better coordination of the local street system development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with the mandates of the State Transportation Planning Rule and Regional Transportation Plan for street connectivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Southwest and Far Southeast master street plans were developed through a number of steps, with mapping associated with each step:</p>
<p><em>Step One</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define blocks in the study area that meet the spacing standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define areas being excluded (areas where streets are complete or underway; parcels zoned as park, open space, or industrial; religious or educational institutions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Step Two</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define remaining areas that have development or redevelopment potential (land value greater than improvement value; different Comprehensive Plan and zoning designations; two-acre or larger parcels).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define development constraints (street spacing not met, but parcels don’t meet development potential).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Step Three</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Define blocks with barriers to connectivity (environmentally constrained).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Step Four</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Group the remaining areas into focus areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Step Five</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define locations of new connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine specificity of connections – specific points or along a block face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply type of connection – street or pedestrian/bicycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The plans’ recommendations include information about the location, level of alignment specificity, type of connection, barriers, presence of environmental zones, traffic impacts, field notes, and comments from the public or technical staff.</p>
<p>While the master street plans identify a number of future connections, the absence of a connection does not mean a connection is not needed or feasible. All areas within the study areas are still subject to relevant policy and spacing standards.</p>
<h5 id="far-southeast-portland-master-street-plans">Far Southeast Portland Master Street Plans</h5>
<p><strong>Study Area</strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast Portland Master Street Plan includes nearly all of the Far Southeast Transportation District, from I-205 east to the City limit, and from Burnside south to the City limits. Some portions of this area are excluded from the plan: the Gateway regional center because a street plan already exists, and Burnside light rail station areas (102^nd^ to 162^nd^, NE Glisan to SE Stark), where master street plans will be completed as part of TSP refinement plans.</p>
<p><em>Land Use</em></p>
<p>The Far Southeast is predominantly in residential use, with interspersed commercial/retail uses. Commercial/retail uses are located in strip commercial development along arterials such as 122^nd^ and Division or in malls such as Mall 205 or the San Rafael Shopping Center. Institutions, such as colleges, hospitals, and schools, can create barriers, but offer limited opportunities for street connections. Cemeteries and parks also occupy significant tracts of land in the district. There are only a few pockets of industrial uses, principally near the Lents town center.</p>
<p><em>Zoning</em></p>
<p>The Far Southeast Master Street Plan Study area includes virtually all of the various City commercial zones, except some designed specifically for the Central City. The area includes nearly all the residential zones, excluding only the most dense zones. The employment and industrial zoning currently in place is confined primarily to the southern edge of the district. Significant tracts of open space zoning exist, with Powell Butte the largest. Environmental overlays are applied to areas with steep slopes and near streams and wetland areas, principally in the southeast portion of the district.</p>
<p><em>Area Character</em></p>
<p>Terrain and the density of development largely determine the area’s character. Some less developed areas display a rural appearance, with open fields and large out-buildings. The majority of the district has a more suburban appearance, with large tracts of single-dwelling homes on medium to large lots. Some areas display a more urban character, with smaller lots and buildings closer to the street. Steep slopes with numerous streams and gullies are located in the southern portion of the area, along Johnson Creek and in Pleasant Valley.</p>
<p>Long-term county stewardship, along with recent population growth, has resulted in relatively few public streets in some areas, and large redevelopable parcels of land. Many of the area’s local service streets and collectors are not fully improved. The lack of sidewalks results in a street system that is not particularly pedestrian friendly. The lack of public streets contributes significantly to out-of-direction travel patterns, and very wide major arterials carry many local trips as well as through-trips.</p>
<p><strong>Issues and Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Barriers (such as terrain, streams, and existing development) will continue to limit a connected street system, including bicycle/pedestrian accessways, in Far Southeast Portland. With expected increases in the number of households and dwelling units in the area, however, completion of the local street system will be needed even more to provide multimodal access to areas of new development and from those areas to neighborhood activity centers, transit, and arterials.</p>

<h6 id="outer-powell-blvd-conceptual-plan-design-2012">Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design (2012)</h6>
<p>The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation, in coordination with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), developed a conceptual design plan for Outer SE Powell Blvd. from the I-205 to SE 174th Ave (city limits). This stretch of SE Powell Blvd is designated State Highway No. 26. Therefore, ODOT has jurisdiction along SE Powell Blvd.</p>
<p>The plan addressed the needs for Outer Powell Blvd in a 20-year time frame. The plan identified improvements and right-of-way width needs that will allow Outer SE Powell Blvd to serve vehicle traffic movement while also improving the safety, accessibility and the aesthetic environment for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders. The Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design was adopted by Resolution 36931 in February 2013.</p>
<p>A component of the plan was improving local connectivity around Powell Blvd. A Local Streets and Access-ways Report identified additional connections in the area.</p>
<p>Six types of connections were identified in the Local Streets and Accessways Report.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Separated In-Roadway Bicycle Facilities.</strong> Facilities that separate the bicycle travel lane from the motor vehicle lane with striping or a physical barrier. Examples are a standard bike lane, buffered bike lane, and cycle track.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bicycle Boulevards/Advisory Bike Lanes.</strong> Facilities on low traffic volume streets where through movement of bicycles is given priority over motor vehicles Advisory bike lanes include dashed bike lane striping and single motor vehicle lane. Vehicles are allowed to enter bike lanes to pass each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pedestrian and Bicycle Pathways.</strong> These facilities are outside of the roadway right-of way and fully separated from the roadway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Street Connections.</strong> New local streets built to City standards. Sidewalks accommodate pedestrian travel and bike travel share the roadway with vehicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pedestrian and Bicycle Crossings.</strong> Two types of crossings were identified. The first type is provided by the existing traffic signals. New signals were not recommended. The second crossing type is shown at generally desired locations between signalized intersections. Specific design treatments were not determined (e.g. pedestrian refuge island, HAWK signal, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential Street Realignment.</strong> Opportunities to realign existing streets through future redevelopment. The objective is to align intersections on opposite sides of Powell Boulevard to improve pedestrian crossings or access to transit stops.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="division-midway-neighborhood-street-plan">Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan</h6>
<p>(Adopted by Resolution No. 37157 October 15, 2015)</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), in partnership with the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), developed the Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan. The Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan was developed to help improve local street and pathway connectivity in several East Portland neighborhoods. The project area is centered on SE Division Street, a designated “Main Street” in the Metro Region 2040 Growth Concept Plan and the study area was bounded by SE 112th Ave, SE 148th Ave, SE Stark and SE Holgate and includes portions of the Hazelwood, Mill Park, Centennial and Powellhurst Gilbert neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Goals and Objectives: The overall goal is to develop a Neighborhood Street Plan that can better increase street connectivity and multi-modal travel options within the project area. Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establish a more connected local street and path network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create safer walking and bicycling routes to neighborhood destinations, transit and the regionally designated SE Division Main Street</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the range of options for improving local streets, including use of Portland Street By Street design options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform future improvements to be built over-time by property owners, developers and the City.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Street Plan identified implementation methods for introducing new street and pathway connections and options for improving deficient local streets. The plan recommended adding New Future Public Connections across Existing Private Property.</p>

<h6 id="tryon-stephens-headwaters-neighborhood-street-plan">Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</h6>
<p>(Adopted by Resolution No. 37162, November 2015)</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) and the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) developed the Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan to create a strategy to complete the transportation network and stormwater system within the study area. The Tryon-Stephens plan provides a strategy for enhancing neighborhood access to local destinations by looking comprehensively at street and drainage issues. The Tryon-Stephens Street Plan sets a framework for tailoring improvements to individual streets based on the adjacent land use, street character, and natural setting.</p>
<p>The plan recommends modifying the City of Portland’s Southwest Master Street Plan (2001) to add future local street/pathway connections in two locations within the study area, as shown on the following map (page 52 of the Tryon-Stevens plan). Recommended new connections are in the Hillsdale neighborhood linking SW Nevada Court to SW Vermont Street between SW 26th Avenue and Capitol Hill Road, and in the Markham Neighborhood linking SW Marigold Street between SW 23rd and SW 26th Avenues.</p>
<p><img src="/img/media/image5.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="areas-not-covered-by-master-street-plans"><strong>Areas not covered by Master Street Plans</strong></h2>
<p>Master Street plans have not been completed for all or parts of the North, Northeast, Far Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Central City districts. Other areas were excluded from the Southwest and Far Southeast Master Street Plans: the east light rail corridor (102nd to the city limits, NE Glisan to SE Stark), the Hillsdale town center, and the West Portland town center. Master Street plans for these areas will be completed as refinement plans of the TSP. Until such plans are completed, the location and implementation of new street and pedestrian/bicycle connections will be governed by Title 17: Public Improvements, and Title 33: Planning and Zoning, requirements in City Code. Title 17 regulations govern developing or redeveloping sites that do not include a land division, and Title 33 regulations govern developing or redeveloping sites that do include a land division. The spacing standards in each title are 530 feet for full street connections and 330 feet for pedestrian/bicycle connections where full street connections are not feasible.</p>
<h1 id="modal-plans">Modal Plans</h1>
<h2 id="motor-vehicle"><strong>Motor Vehicle</strong></h2>
<p>Comp Plan policies were adopted that address motor vehicles. Specific policies include Policy 9.6 Transportation for People Movement; 9.7 Moving goods and delivery services. Policy 9.38 Automobile Transportation which states: Maintain acceptable levels of mobility and access for private automobiles while reducing overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and negative impacts of private automobiles on the environment and human health. This is a new policy specific to motor vehicles in the 2016 Comp Plan.</p>
<h2 id="public-transportation"><strong>Public Transportation</strong></h2>
<p><strong>TriMet Service Enhancement Plans</strong></p>
<p>PBOT worked with Trimet, riders, residents, neighborhood groups, governments, schools and businesses to plan improvements to transit service. The long-term vision developed identifies and prioritizes opportunities to improve bus service as well as pedestrian and bike access to transit.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.trimet.org/category/service-enhancement-plans/">[http://news.trimet.org/category/service-enhancement-plans/]{.underline}</a></p>
<p><strong>Growing Transit Communities Plan (GTC)</strong></p>
<p>The Growing Transit Communities Plan is an effort to identify and prioritize the most beneficial improvements that would make getting to the bus and using the bus, a safer and more convenient option along sections of 3 bus lines 87, 77, and 20. The purpose of the GTC Plan is to determine a package of transportation investments on a corridor level that would best create transit-oriented neighborhoods, places where transit (along with walking and bicycling for short trips) is truly the mode of choice for getting to and from work, school, shops, or other destinations. Frequent transit service is one essential component of a transit-oriented community, but other components include safe access to transit, bus stop quality, sidewalk and bikeway network connections, crossings of busy streets, and the overall built environment. Deficiencies in these other factors often lead to lower ridership, and make frequent service less viable to implement.</p>
<p>The Portland Plan and the Climate Action Plan have established a mode split goal of 25% of all trips on transit by 2035, and the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan includes a goal of tripling transit mode share over 2005 levels. Increasing transit service frequency and targeted investments in access to transit are ways to increase transit ridership. Implementation of this Plan will help the City reach these policy goals and accommodate future growth.</p>
<p>Data from Metro’s 2011 Travel Activity Survey indicates that 6.6% of trips in Portland are currently on transit, increasing only 20% between 1994 and 2011. Additional support for transit is needed, as the current growth trend is not aggressive enough to meet mode share targets and accommodate the transportation needs of expected population and employment growth. The Comprehensive Plan, prioritizes transit-oriented centers and corridors to accommodate expected population and employment growth while minimizing traffic growth. TriMet developed its Service Enhancement Plans to present long-term visions for the future development of the transit system. These two planning efforts combined work together to provide high-frequency and high-capacity transit to areas identified for high-density residential and employment land uses. This coordination results in a concentration of compact, 20-minute neighborhoods where transit is the mode of choice for longer trips to other parts of the City or region.</p>
<p>Transit and higher density zoning alone are not sufficient to produce the levels of development and transit use to meet regional goals. Without safe pedestrian and bicycle access to transit, high-quality transit stops, fast and reliable transit operations, parking management, and effective demand management, the automobile will likely be the preferred mode. TriMet’s future investment and improving and expanding the frequent transit network will be prioritized based on the level of local access investments, transit-supportive policies, and priority treatments. TriMet and the City will work together to update corridors with transit-supportive investments to help support both frequent transit service and transit-oriented development. Targeted investments in access to transit, stop amenities, transit priority treatments, and demand management are ways to increase transit ridership. This project will help the City reach the adopted Climate Action Plan goal of achieving a 25% transit mode share by 2035. Making early investments before anticipated development will ensure future residents and employees find transit to be an attractive travel choice when they are moving or changing jobs and are most receptive to a change in mode choice. Transit-supportive investments have additional benefits by improving pedestrian and bicycle networks and enhancing transit service used by a wider population than those who work and live along the corridor. These investments will also help corridors meet TriMet’s criteria for frequent service expansion, allowing the City to leverage investments for increased transit service hours.</p>

<p><strong>Recent Transit Improvements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Streetcar Loop</strong></p>
<p>Since first opening service from NW 23rd Avenue to Portland State University in 2001, PBOT and Portland Streetcar, Inc. have worked together to continuously fine tune and improve the efficiency and reliability of Portland Streetcar. A subcommittee of the Citizen Advisory Committee created a list of projects that could reduce travel times and improve reliability. The next suggestion on the list is the consolidation of stops.</p>
<p><a href="https://portlandstreetcar.org/news/2016/01/track-to-the-future">https://portlandstreetcar.org/news/2016/01/track-to-the-future</a></p>
<p><strong>Light Rail</strong></p>
<p>The Orange and Green Lines were built to connect to Clackamas Town Center (Green) and Downtown Milwaukee (Orange). The Orange line opened in September 2015 with the addition of the Tilikum Crossing, a bridge that does not accommodate motor vehicles but is for bikes, peds and transit.</p>
<p><strong>Southwest Corridor Plan (SWC)</strong></p>
<p>A key part of the Southwest Corridor Plan is a proposed 12-mile MAX light rail line from downtown Portland to Tigard and Bridgeport Village in Tualatin, along with numerous walking, biking and roadway projects to help people access stations. This plan has been created as a partnership of seven cities, Washington County and the Metro Council, along with TriMet and the Oregon Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>The Southwest Corridor Plan includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new 12-mile MAX line from downtown Portland to Tigard and Bridgeport Village in Tualatin <a href="http://www.oregonmetro.gov/public-projects/southwest-corridor-plan/light-rail-study">Learn more</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roadway, bicycle and pedestrian projects to help people get to transit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A strategy to promote equitable development in the corridor when light rail is constructed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A specific equitable housing strategy for Tigard and Portland along the light rail line</p>

<p><strong>Division Transit Project</strong></p>
<p>The Division Transit Project will improve travel between Downtown Portland, Southeast and East Portland and Gresham with easier, faster and more reliable bus service. Metro began planning for the project in 2014 by convening a project Steering Committee and holding a series of public open houses and meetings. Metro transferred project leadership to TriMet on December 20, 2016. The Division Transit Project will include design elements such as improved pedestrian crossings at stations, and coordination with other efforts, such as the City of Portland’s Outer SE Division Near-Term Safety Strategy and the Powell-Division Transit and Development Project (Powell-Division), to make Division safer for all users.</p>
<p><a href="https://trimet.org/division/index.htm">https://trimet.org/division/index.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Fareless Square discontinued</strong></p>
<p>Fareless Square was created in 1975 to reduce emissions and auto traffic in the downtown area. In 2010, TriMet voted to eliminate free bus service in Fareless Square, which did cover downtown, Old Town, the convention center and Lloyd Center.</p>
<p><strong>Streetcar plan and extensions</strong></p>
<p>Adopted by Portland City Council on September 9, 2009, the Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan (SSCP) identifies potential corridors that will build upon the success of the existing streetcar system and expand service to best serve Portland’s neighborhoods and business districts. The streetcar is a key element in the city’s plan for more sustainable future growth.</p>
<p><strong>Streetcar System Concept Plan Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan can play a key role in shaping the City by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reinforcing walkable and economically diverse neighborhoods and vibrant main streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging sustainable and equitable development and infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting reduction of vehicle trips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting greater accessibility, housing options, employment, and economic development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Streetcar System Concept Plan Goals</strong></p>
<p>A successful streetcar system will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Help Portland achieve its peak oil and sustainability strategies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an organizing structure and catalyst for Portland’s future growth along streetcar corridors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate streetcar corridors into Portland’s existing neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Successful streetcar corridors need to:</strong></p>
<p>1. Be a viable transit option with adequate ridership.</p>
<p>2. Have (re)development potential.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate community support to make the changes necessary for a successful streetcar corridor</p>
<p>The SSCP project has expanded the conversation about streetcar from a downtown incrementally-growing transit mode into citywide strategic economic development tool and neighborhood circulator.</p>

<h2 id="pedestrian"><strong>Pedestrian</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Comp Plan Policies</strong></p>
<p>Comp Plan policies 9.6 and 9.17-19 are pedestrian policies. There are additional policies in Chapter 8, 3 and 4 that address pedestrian infrastructure and services.</p>
<p><strong>Pedestrian Master Plan (PedPDX)</strong></p>
<p>PedPDX is Portland’s citywide pedestrian plan. It will prioritize sidewalk and crossing improvements and other investments to make walking safer and more comfortable across the city. The plan will identify the key strategies and tools we will use to make Portland a truly great walking city.</p>
<p>PedPDX is an update of the <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/index.cfm?a=90244">1998 Pedestrian Master Plan</a> (PMP). Since 1998, the PMP has guided pedestrian-friendly design and policies in Portland, and has served as a model across the country. The PMP developed a project list that has guided investment over the past 18 years.</p>
<p>There is more we can do to make Portland a great walking city. Despite consistent investment in the pedestrian network, significant gaps and deficiencies remain, and new policy questions have emerged. An incomplete pedestrian network limits the City’s ability to absorb growth and meet the livability and access needs of residents, including safe walking access to public transit and essential services. The 1998 Pedestrian Master Plan has served inner Portland well, but has often struggled to provide adequate guidance for areas such as East Portland and Southwest Portland that present environmental challenges and right-of-way constraints.</p>
<p>PedPDX will reflect changes to pedestrian policy and design best practices that have emerged since the original Pedestrian Master Plan was adopted, including an emerging understanding of transportation equity and a <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/40390">Vision Zero</a> approach to pedestrian safety. The updated plan will ensure that the City continues to lead the way in walkability, and will allow Portland to absorb growth in a sustainable way that encourages residents to walk, whether for commuting, shopping, going to school, or recreation.</p>
<p>The PedPDX citywide pedestrian plan will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establish a clear plan vision, goals, and objectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify gaps and needs in Portland’s pedestrian network (including needs for new sidewalks, crossings, and other pedestrian improvements)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize needs to ensure that we are directing funding to locations with the greatest needs first (project prioritization will reflect the City’s commitment to improving equity outcomes and reaching our Vision Zero goal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Articulate the strategies, actions, and tools we will use to improve walking conditions within prioritized areas, and across the city</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify context-sensitive design solutions for various part of the city</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the City’s pedestrian classifications and designations, which help drive pedestrian design requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the performance measures we will use to track our progress implementing the plan over time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Future phases of PedPDX will update the <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/84048">1998 Pedestrian Design Guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Comp Plan Policies</strong></p>
<p>Comp Plan policies 9.6 and 9.20 - 9.21 are bicycle policies. There are additional policies in Chapter 8, 3 and 4 that address bicycle infrastructure and services.</p>
<p><strong>Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030 was adopted unanimously by Portland’s City Council on February 11, 2010. The <em>Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030</em> aims to make bicycling a critical component of our city’s overall transportation system and a significant element of our sustainable green economy. More than an update of the 1996 plan, it proposes fundamental changes to city policy, to bikeway design, to the density of our bikeway network and to an array of supporting efforts and programs. The Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030 also identifies the many benefits that will accrue to Portland as a result of its implementation.</p>
<p>Key principles of the <em>Portland Bicycle Plan for 203</em>0:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attract new riders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen bicycle policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form a denser bikeway network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase bicycle parking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand programs to support bicycling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase funding for bicycle facilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bicycling creates safer streets, reduces the causes of global climate change, promotes a healthy environment, and limits the effects and health care costs related to inactivity. It provides equity and access to viable, affordable transportation options and creates fun, vibrant, and livable neighborhoods. It supports Portland’s economy and is a sound investment.</p>
<p>Projects identified in the Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030 have been added into the 2016 TSP list of projects.</p>

<h2 id="freight"><strong>Freight</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Comp Plan Policies</strong></p>
<p>Comp Plan policies 9.7 and 9.30 - 9.36 are freight policies. There are also freight related policies in Chapter 6: Economic Development.</p>
<p><strong>Freight Master Plan</strong></p>
<p>The City of Portland Freight Master Plan was adopted May 10, 2006 and provided a roadmap for managing freight movement and commercial delivery of goods and services in Portland, today and into the future. The goal is to foster a freight system that works for the community. The Freight Master Plan objectives center around three main themes: mobility, livability, and healthy economy. After 10 years, a new update of the Freight Master Plan is underway.</p>
<p>The Portland area has historically been a center of trade and commerce in the Pacific Northwest and, because of its connections to the interstate highway network, marine and rail terminals and an international airport, is the fourth largest freight hub for domestic and international trade on the west coast; behind the Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco regions.</p>
<p>Portland’s freight hub is characterized by its 12,500 acres of industrial land surrounding the Portland Harbor and the Portland International Airport, which accommodates most of the region’s heavy industrial activities - marine terminals, rail yards, large manufacturing and warehousing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The City of Portland completed its first Transportation System Plan (TSP) in 2002. During this process, the City recognized the need to better understand freight-related issues in order to:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure Portland’s transportation network can support the projected increased demand for freight movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance freight mobility needs with community impacts and other transportation modes (bicycle, pedestrian, transit, auto).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take advantage of economic opportunities and changes in the global economy by capitalizing on Portland’s inherent geographic advantage and existing multimodal freight transportation system (marine, rail, air, highway, pipeline).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the 2002 Port of Portland Commodity Flow Forecast, demand for freight tonnage into, out of, and within the Portland area will grow from 260 million tons with a total value of $352 billion in 1997 to 522 million tons with a combined value of $827 billion by 2030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The volume of freight tonnage in the Portland area is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.1%. The overall share of freight tonnage by year 2030 is projected to be: Truck (73%), Rail (11%), Ocean and Barge (10%), Pipeline (6%), and Air (&lt;1%).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What Does the Freight Master Plan Do?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Freight Master Plan is part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan - the policy guide for City growth and development - and one of the modal elements of the City’s Transportation System Plan, which elevates freight to the same level as the other modal plans (bicycle, pedestrian, motor vehicle, transportation demand management, transit) by addressing the unique characteristics, needs and impacts of freight movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;!-- --&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>Established the Portland Freight Committee, which brought together a diverse group of members representing various multi-modal freight service providers, shippers, trade associations, and businesses involved in freight activities as well as public agency representatives from the local, state, and federal levels. The Portland Freight Committee serves as an advisory group to the Mayor, Portland City Council and the Portland Bureau of Transportation on freight related issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is the Freight Master Plan Implemented?</strong> The capital projects, programs and activities identified in Freight Master Plan were developed based on three core values:</p>

<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p>The Transportation System Plan uses clear, everyday language as much as possible. Words and terms in the Glossary have the specific meaning stated below when used in the Comprehensive Plan and TSP, unless the context clearly indicates another meaning. Words not included in this Glossary are defined by their dictionary meaning, or in some cases, by their meaning in state or federal law.</p>
<p><strong>2040 Growth Concept</strong></p>
<p>A concept for the long-term growth management of our region, developed by Metro. It describes the preferred form of regional growth, including where growth should be clustered, what the appropriate densities are for various land use design types, and which areas should be protected as open space. The 2040 Growth Concept was adopted as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. (Source: 2000 RTP)</p>
<p><strong>Access</strong></p>
<p>The ability to approach or make use of transportation facilities, parks and open space, public infrastructure, or businesses and services that are open to the public. Good access means within close proximity (up to ó mile) that is free from physical barriers for those with limited mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Access Management</strong></p>
<p>Measures regulating access to streets, roads, and highways from public roads and private driveways. Measures may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the siting of interchanges, restrictions on the type and amount of access to roadways, and use of physical controls (such as signals and channelization, including raised medians) to reduce impacts of approach road traffic on the main facility.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>The ability to move easily from one mode of transportation to another mode or to a destination. Accessibility increases when the number and quality of travel choices increases. Accessibility is affected by the mix of land uses and the travel alternatives available.</p>
<p><strong>Accessway</strong></p>
<p>A type of right-of-way, either public or private, that is primarily to provide pedestrian and bicycle linkages consistent with connectivity needs, but may be used for vehicle access to parking or for emergency vehicles. Accessways are typically short in length and are used where full street connections are not needed and/or are not physically feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Active Transportation</strong></p>
<p>Transportation that involves physical activity, including walking, biking and using transit.</p>
<p><strong>Activity Center</strong></p>
<p>A cluster of uses that collectively generates many trips (e.g., school and park, neighborhood commercial district). An activity center can be a single use that generates many trips (e.g., stadium, large commercial outlet, large institution).</p>
<p><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990</strong></p>
<p>Civil rights legislation enacted by Congress that mandates the development of a plan to address discrimination and equal opportunity for disabled persons in employment, transportation, public accommodation, public services, and telecommunications.</p>
<p><strong>Area Permit Parking Program</strong></p>
<p>A Portland Bureau of Transportation program to ensure that on-street parking associated with commercial, industrial, institutional development or large events will not spill over into adjacent residential neighborhoods. The program allows residents and firms a limited supply of permits for on-street parking and restricts on-street parking for other potential users.</p>
<p><strong>Arterial</strong></p>
<p>Any street that is not a Local Service Traffic Street according to the traffic classification maps in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Arterials include Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, Neighborhood Collectors, and Traffic Access Streets.</p>
<p><em>Also:</em> A class of street. Arterial streets interconnect and support the throughway system. Arterials are intended to provide general mobility for travel within the region. Correctly sized arterials at appropriate intervals allow through trips to remain on the arterial system thereby discouraging use of local streets for cut-through travel. Arterial streets link major commercial, residential, industrial and institutional areas. Major arterials serve longer distance through trips and serve more of a regional traffic function. Minor arterials serve shorter, more localized travel within a community. As a result, major arterials usually carry more traffic than minor arterials. Arterial streets are usually spaced about one mile apart and are designed to accommodate bicycle, pedestrian, truck and transit travel.</p>
<p><strong>Attractor</strong></p>
<p>A use that, by its nature, draws large numbers of people to it for special events or regular activities. Regional attractors include uses such as sports arenas and convention centers.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-Oriented Development</strong></p>
<p>Development that is either: 1) auto-related (such as gas stations and auto repair shops) or 2) auto-accommodating (by its design attracts primarily customers and employees arriving by automobile, such as drive-in restaurants).</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark</strong></p>
<p>A specific target or goal to be achieved in a specific timeframe. Benchmarks are used to determine the attainment of performance indicators and performance measures (defined below).</p>
<p><strong>Bicycle</strong></p>
<p>A vehicle having two tandem wheels, a minimum of 14 inches in diameter, propelled by human power, upon which a person or persons may ride. A three-wheeled adult tricycle is considered a bicycle. In Oregon, a bicycle is legally defined as a vehicle. Bicyclists have the same right to the roadways and must obey the same traffic laws as the operators of other vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Bicycle Boulevard</strong></p>
<p>See Neighborhood Greenway.</p>
<p><strong>Bicyclist</strong></p>
<p>Person riding a bicycle.</p>
<p><strong>Bike Share</strong></p>
<p>Bike Share is an innovative transportation program that provides users access to bicycles on a short-term basis for one-way travel within a designated service area.</p>
<p><strong>Carpool</strong></p>
<p>A motor vehicle carrying two or three (depending on the context) or more people, usually commuting on a regular or semi-regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Car Sharing</strong></p>
<p>An organization consisting of a group of individuals who share a fleet of cars. The purchase or lease of vehicles, fuel costs, maintenance and repair costs is borne by the organization.</p>
<p><strong>Centers</strong></p>
<p>Places with concentrations of commercial and community services, housing, gathering places, and transit connections. Centers provide services to surrounding neighborhoods and are intended to be enhanced as places because they are a focus of housing and job growth. There are four types of centers with varying functions, levels of activity, and scales and intensities of development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Central City: Corresponds to the Central City plan district, which serves as the region’s premier center, anchoring an interconnected system of centers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gateway Regional Center: Corresponds to the Gateway plan district, East Portland’s largest center, which is intended to be enhanced as an employment and community service hub within the area and region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Town Centers: Large centers that serve a broad area of the city and have an important role in accommodating growth. They provide a full range of commercial and community services, high-density housing, mid-rise commercial and mid-rise mixed-use buildings (typically up to five to seven stories in height), are served by high-capacity transit connections, and have a substantial employment component. Town Centers provide housing opportunities for enough population to support a full-service business district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Centers: Centers that primarily serve adjacent neighborhoods and provide opportunities for additional housing and low- to mid-rise commercial and mixed-use buildings (typically up to three to five stories in height). They provide a range of local commercial and community services and transit connections. Neighborhood Centers provide housing opportunities for about half the population needed to support a neighborhood business district.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>City Greenway</strong></p>
<p>A system of distinctive pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly green streets and trails, enhanced by lush tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that support active living by expanding transportation and recreational opportunities and making it easier and more attractive to reach destinations across the city. City Greenways are a network that includes the following types of infrastructure:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enhanced greenway corridors are distinctive green streets with extensive tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that provide connections between major centers, schools, parks, natural areas, and the rivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trails are often located along rivers or through natural areas, providing pedestrian and bicycle connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heritage parkways are iconic streets or segments of streets with elements such as linear parkways, scenic views, and distinctive landscaping or street design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood greenways are an extensive network of streets with low volumes of motor vehicle traffic that are prioritized for bicycles and enhanced for pedestrians, working in conjunction with the rest of the City Greenways system to extend the system into all neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Collector of Regional Significance</strong></p>
<p>As designated in the 2000 Regional Transportation Plan, a route that connects the regional arterial system and the local system by collecting and distributing neighborhood traffic to arterial streets. Collectors of regional significance have three purposes: 1) They ensure adequate access to the primary and secondary land use components of the 2040 Growth Concept; 2) They allow dispersion of arterial traffic over a number of lesser facilities where an adequate local network exists; 3) They help define appropriate collector level movement between jurisdictions. (Source: 2000 RTP)</p>
<p><strong>Collector Street</strong></p>
<p>A class of street. Collector streets provide both access and circulation between residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural community areas and the arterial system. As such, collectors tend to carry fewer motor vehicles than arterial streets, with reduced travel speeds. Collector streets are usually spaced at half-mile intervals, midway between arterial streets. Collectors may serve as bike, pedestrian and freight access routes, providing local connections to the arterial street network and transit system. While the focus for collectors has been on motor vehicle traffic, they are developed as multi-modal facilities that accommodate bicycles, pedestrians and transit.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Streets</strong></p>
<p>Complete streets provide accessibility to all users of the right-of-way regardless of age, ability, or mode of transportation. They are designed and operated to make better places and to enhance safe access for all modes, including people walking and bicycling, those using a mobility device, motorists, and transit users.</p>
<p><strong>Community Uses</strong></p>
<p>Community uses in the right of way include but are not limited to temporary uses such as public gathering spaces, events, food production or temporary festivals, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Congestion</strong></p>
<p>A condition characterized by unstable traffic flows that prevents reliable movement on a transportation facility.</p>
<p><strong>Connected Vehicle</strong></p>
<p>A vehicle that communicates with the Internet, other vehicles, wayside systems and/or passengers.</p>
<p><strong>Corridor</strong></p>
<p>1. Corridors (2040 design type) – A type of land use that is typically located along regional transit routes and arterial streets, providing a place for somewhat higher densities than is found in 2040 centers. These land uses should feature a high-quality pedestrian environment and convenient access to transit. Typical new developments would include rowhouses, duplexes and one to three-story office and retail buildings, and average about 25 persons per acre. While some corridors may be continuous, narrow bands of higher-intensity development along arterial streets, others may be more nodal, that is a series of smaller centers at major intersections or other locations along the arterial that have high quality pedestrian environments, good connection to adjacent neighborhoods and transit service.</p>
<p>2. Corridor as defined in the Comprehensive Plan is an area that may be a single major street, or a broad mobility corridor that provides connections for a range of transportation modes (transit, pedestrians, cyclists, freight, motor vehicles, and so forth), not necessarily on the same street. There are three types of corridor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Civic Corridor: These are a prioritized subset of the city’s most prominent transit and transportation streets. They connect centers, provide regional connections, and include segments where commercial development and housing are focused. Civic Corridors are intended to continue their important transportation functions while providing livable environments for people, and evolving into distinctive places that are models of ecological design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Corridor: Main streets that connect neighborhoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They support neighborhood business districts and provide housing opportunities close to local services, amenities, and transit lines. They are streets that include a mix of commercial and higher-density housing development. They have less intense development and transportation function than Civic Corridors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freight Corridor: Primary routes into and through the city that support Portland as an important West Coast hub and a gateway for international and domestic trade. These facilities are integral to the growth of traded sector businesses such as manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution industries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Curb Zone</strong></p>
<p>The area of public right-of-way adjacent to the curb that can be used for a wide variety of mobility and access functions, including but not limited to vehicle lanes, bike lanes, curb extensions, transit platforms, street trees, loading zones, on-street parking, bike corrals, and street seats.</p>
<p><strong>Early Bird Parking</strong></p>
<p>Parking that is provided to encourage its use primarily by commuters. Typically, the pricing strategy is to offer a lower all-day rate if the parker arrives before a certain time in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Electric Vehicle</strong></p>
<p>An electric vehicle (EV), also referred to as an electric drive vehicle, is a vehicle which uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Depending on the type of vehicle, motion may be provided by wheels or propellers driven by rotary motors, or in the case of tracked vehicles, by linear motors.</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Response Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>Vehicles employed in responding to emergencies. Examples of emergency response vehicles include fire apparatus, ambulances, and police cars.</p>
<p><strong>Employer Commute Options (ECO)</strong></p>
<p>DEQ ECO program required employers with more than 100 employees to provide commute options to employees designed to reduce the number of cars driven to work in Portland and surrounding areas.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact Statement</strong></p>
<p>An environmental assessment required by the National Environmental Protection Act for “any major Federal action that may significantly affect the environment.”</p>
<p><strong>Faves</strong></p>
<p>Fleet, fully Automated Vehicles that are Electric and Shared.</p>
<p><strong>Freight</strong></p>
<p>Raw and bulk materials and products that require value-adding or warehousing.</p>
<p><strong>Freight Intermodal Facility</strong></p>
<p>An intercity facility where freight is transferred between two or more modes (e.g., truck to rail, rail to ship, truck to air, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Frequent Service (Trimet)</strong></p>
<p>Bus or MAX Light Rail transit service that runs every 15 minutes or better most of the day, every day.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Plan</strong></p>
<p>A limited-purpose, multijurisdictional plan for an area or activity having significant districtwide impact on the orderly and responsible development of the metropolitan area. A Functional Plan serves as a guideline for local comprehensive plans consistent with ORS 268.390.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>The broadest expressions of a community’s desires. Goals give direction and are concerned with the long term; they often describe ideal situations.</p>
<p><strong>Goods</strong></p>
<p>Finished products, commodities, and wares ready for the final consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Green Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Public or private assets — either natural resources or engineered green facilities — that protect, support, or mimic natural systems to provide stormwater management, water quality, public health and safety, open space, and other complementary ecosystem services. Examples include trees, ecoroofs, green street facilities, wetlands, and natural waterways.</p>
<p><strong>Green Street</strong></p>
<p>A green street is a street with a landscaped street-side planter or bioswale that captures stormwater runoff from the street and allows it to soak into the ground as soil and vegetation filter out pollutants. A green street is not the same as a City Greenway, though a City Greenway may include green street elements.</p>
<p><strong>High-capacity Transit</strong></p>
<p>High-capacity transit is public transit that bypasses congestion by making full or partial use of exclusive right of way, a non-exclusive right of way, using transit priority or a combination of both. Vehicles make fewer stops, travel at higher speeds, have more frequent service, and carry more people than local service transit such as typical bus lines.
