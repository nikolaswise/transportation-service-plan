                  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Portland is projected to add 140,000 new jobs and 260,000 new residents over the next 20 years. As Portland and the region grow, however, there is a continuing challenge to maintain the natural environment, economic prosperity, and overall quality of life. If in 2035 the percentage of people who drive alone to work remains the same as it is now (nearly 60 percent), traffic, carbon emissions, and household spending on vehicles and fuel will all worsen significantly. In order to accommodate this growth, our transportation system must provide Portlanders safer and more convenient ways to walk, bike, and take transit for more trips. The 2035 Transportation System Plan guides investments to maintain and improve the livability of Portland by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>supporting the City’s commitment to Vision Zero by saving lives and reducing injuries to all people using our transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>limiting traffic congestion so transit and freight vehicles can move more reliably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reducing, carbon emissions and promoting healthy lifestyles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keeping more money in the local economy, as we spend less on vehicles and fuel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creating great places</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Transportation System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide transportation policies and investments in Portland. The TSP meets state and regional planning requirements and addresses local transportation needs. Transportation planning that promotes active transportation modes is essential to preserving the City’s livability and for the protection of the natural environment Constructing significant amounts of new automobile capacity to accommodate growth is not a viable option because of the enormous costs and impacts. Adding more streets and parking lots divides neighborhoods, uses valuable land, encourages urban sprawl, and has negative environmental impacts. Alternative approaches, supporting a safer, more affordable and more complete multimodal transportation network must be used to ensure integrated, comprehensive solutions. The first TSP was adopted by Council in 2002 (Ordinance 177028).</p>
<p>The Transportation System Plan helps implement the City’s 2035 Comprehensive Plan in addition to the region’s 2040 Growth Concept by supporting a transportation system that makes it more convenient for people to walk, bicycle, use transit, and drive less to meet their daily needs. The TSP also recognizes that the transportation system must help grow and sustain the City’s economic health by accommodating the needs of businesses and supporting Portland’s role in the international economy.</p>
<p><strong>The 2035 TSP includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Goals and policies that guide the maintenance, development and implementation of Portland’s transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objectives that further the implementation of the goals and policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of projects and City wide programs along with a financial plan that would accommodate 20 years of population and employment growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master street plans and modal plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategies and regulations for implementation, including street classifications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="elements-of-the-tsp">Elements of the TSP</h2>
<p>The goals and policies, street classification descriptions and maps, the financial plan and the master street plan maps in the TSP were adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan by City Council in 2016. The TSP was adopted concurrently with the Comprehensive Plan, but published under a separate cover. Stage 3 Update will be adopted separately from the Comp Plan and Stages 1 and 2, then incorporated into one TSP document.</p>
<p>The TSP is both an implementation tool and a supporting document to the Comprehensive Plan. It contains the transportation element of the City’s Public Facilities Plan, and the List of Significant Projects and Citywide Programs. The TSP also provides more detail than the Comprehensive Plan by including additional supporting information about transportation system conditions.</p>
<p><img src="/img/media/image2.png" alt="Relation to Other Plans_updated 10_03_14.png"></p>
<h2 id="transportation-system-plan-updates">Transportation System Plan Updates</h2>
<p>In order to keep the TSP current and up-to-date with recent transportation planning and development activities, it is updated at regular intervals. The first two updates in the mid-2000s were not intended to include new policy initiatives. They were primarily technical in nature and included corrections, updates to project descriptions, updates on studies, and inclusion of new master street plans adopted as a part of planning efforts.</p>
<p>The first update was completed and adopted by City Council on October 13, 2004 (effective date, November 12, 2004; Ordinance Nos. 178815 and 178826).</p>
<p>The second update was completed and adopted by City Council on April 5, 2007 (effective date, May 5, 2007; Ordinance No 180871). While primarily technical in nature, this update also included new policy language to implement the City’s Green Street Policy.</p>
<p>Stage 1 TSP Update was a part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan update process and a component of the state’s Periodic Work Plan Task 4. It included Goals, Policies, Projects and Programs and a Financial Plan. It was adopted by City Council in June 2016.</p>
<p>The Stage 2 TSP Update was a part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan update and changes were made to implement the Comp Plan, as well as reflect adopted plans and classification changes since the last update in 2007. Periodic Work Plan Task 5. It was adopted by City Council in December 2016.</p>
<p>TSP Stage 3 TSP Update is incorporating regional information, updating geographic policies and objectives, updating objectives, adding a few policies, changes to street classification for traffic, transit and emergency response, modal plans, and other changes as identified. There is also parallel staff process to reformat the document and create a new user friendly digital document.</p>
<h2 id="regulatory-framework">Regulatory Framework</h2>
<p>The TSP addresses and complies with a number of State and regional goals, policies, and regulations, as summarized below.</p>
<p>State of Oregon</p>
<p><em>Statewide Planning Goals</em></p>
<p>Oregon has 19 goals that provide a foundation for the State’s land use planning program. The TSP must comply with all applicable State goals. The two goals directly applicable to the TSP are Goal 11: Public Facilities Plan and Goal 12: Transportation.</p>
<p><em>Transportation Planning Rule</em></p>
<p>The Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) implements statewide planning Goal 12: Transportation. The TPR requires State, regional, and local jurisdictions to develop Transportation System Plans (TSPs) that comply with TPR provisions. These provisions include reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 10 percent over the next 20 years, reducing parking spaces per capita, and improving opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<p><em>Oregon Transportation Plan</em></p>
<p>The Oregon Transportation Plan (OTP) serves as the State’s TSP. Regional and local TSPs must be consistent with the OTP.</p>
<p>Regional Metro</p>
<p><em>Regional Transportation Plan</em></p>
<p>First adopted by Metro in 1983, with latest update in 2014, the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) serves as the regional TSP. As such, the RTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is consistent with the requirements of the State TPR and OTP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implements the 2040 Growth Concept and Regional Framework Plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focuses on the regional transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes multimodal functional classifications and street design classifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes a list of major system improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes a funding plan</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of August 2017 Metro and regional partners are updating the RTP with a new RTP to be issued in 2018.</p>
<p><em>Region 2040 Growth Concept</em></p>
<p>Metro adopted the 2040 Growth Concept as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. The 2040 Growth Concept stated the preferred form of long-term regional growth and development, including the urban growth boundary (UGB), density, and open space protection. It also designates design types, such as central city, regional center, town center, and main street.</p>
<p><em>Regional Transportation Functional Plan</em></p>
<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (first adopted in 2010, last updated in 2012; Ordinance No 10-1241B) implements the Goals and Objectives in section 2.3 of the RTP and the policies of the RTP, and replaces the regional parking policy of the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (See RTFP Title 4: Regional Parking Management.) It provides policy basis and direction for local TSPs. The RTFP codifies requirements that local plans must comply with to be consistent with the Regional Transportation Plan. Therefore, its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>
<p><em>Urban Growth Management Functional Plan</em></p>
<p>Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP) in 1996 and updated it 2014 to implement regional goals and objectives adopted by the Metro Council as the Regional Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGO), including the 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework Plan. The UGMFP addresses the accommodation of regional population and job growth. Its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>
<p><em>Regional Framework Plan</em></p>
<p>The Regional Framework Plan, adopted in 1997, identifies regional policies to implement the 2040 Growth Concept, preserving access to nature and building great communities for today and the future. The plan was amended in 2005 and 2010, and again in 2014 as part of the adoption of the Climate Smart Strategy.</p>

<h1 id="street-classification-descriptions">Street Classification Descriptions</h1>
<h2 id="pedestrian-classification-descriptions-adopted-2002-currently-under-review-see-the-update-of-the-pedestrian-master-plan">Pedestrian Classification Descriptions <em>(adopted 2002, currently under review. See the update of the Pedestrian Master Plan)</em></h2>
<p>Pedestrian Classification Descriptions maintain a system of pedestrianways to serve all types of pedestrian trips, particularly those with a transportation function.</p>
<h3 id="pedestrian-districts">Pedestrian Districts</h3>
<p>Pedestrian Districts are intended to give priority to pedestrian access in areas where high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned, including the Central City, Gateway regional center, town centers, and station communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Zoning should allow a transit-supportive density of residential and commercial uses that support lively and intensive pedestrian activity. Auto- oriented development should be discouraged in Pedestrian Districts. Institutional campuses that generate high levels of pedestrian activity may be included in Pedestrian Districts. Exceptions to the density and zoning criteria may be appropriate in some designated historic districts with a strong pedestrian orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Streets within a District:</strong> Make walking the mode of choice for all trips within a Pedestrian District. All streets within a Pedestrian District are equal in importance in serving pedestrian trips and should have sidewalks on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The size and configuration of a Pedestrian District should be consistent with the scale of walking trips. A Pedestrian District includes both sides of the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway. In these instances, the land up to the Regional Trafficway is considered part of the Pedestrian District, but the Regional Trafficway itself is not.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> A Pedestrian District should have, or be planned to have, frequent transit service and convenient access to transit stops.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design streets within Pedestrian Districts. Improvements may include widened sidewalks, curb extensions, street lighting, street trees, and signing. Where two arterials cross, design treatments such as curb extensions, median pedestrian refuges, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals should be considered to minimize the crossing distance, direct pedestrians across the safest route, and provide safe gaps in the traffic stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="pedestrian-transit-streets">Pedestrian-Transit Streets</h3>
<p>Pedestrian-Transit Streets are intended to create a strong and visible relationship between pedestrians and transit within the Central City.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Pedestrian-Transit Streets respond to significant public investments in public transportation, including light rail, the transit mall, and streetcar, and enhance the pedestrian environment adjacent to high-density land uses.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Improvements should include wide sidewalks to accommodate high levels of pedestrian traffic, urban design features that promote pedestrian activity, and visual signals to motor vehicles to recognize the priority of pedestrian and transit vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="city-walkways">City Walkways</h3>
<p>City Walkways are intended to provide safe, convenient, and attractive pedestrian access to activities along major streets and to recreation and institutions; provide connections between neighborhoods; and provide access to transit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> City Walkways should serve areas with dense zoning, commercial areas, and major destinations. Where auto-oriented land uses are allowed on City Walkways, site development standards should address the needs of pedestrians for access.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design City Walkways. Consider special design treatment for City Walkways that are also designated as Regional or Community Main Streets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="off-street-paths">Off-Street Paths</h3>
<p>Off-Street Paths are intended to serve recreational and other walking trips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Use Off-Street Paths as shortcuts to link urban destinations and origins along continuous greenbelts such as rivers, park and forest areas, and other scenic corridors, and used as elements of a regional, citywide, or community recreational trail plan.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Establish Off-Street Paths in corridors not well served by the street system. On existing rights-of-way that are not developed or likely to be developed in the near future, Off-Street Paths may be designated where needed to complete the pedestrian system.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Off-Street Paths. Design Off-Street Paths as separated facilities that accommodate pedestrians and may accommodate other non-motorized vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-walkways">Local Service Walkways</h3>
<p>Local Service Walkways are intended to serve local circulation needs for pedestrians and provide safe and convenient access to local destinations, including safe routes to schools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Local Service Walkways are usually located in residential, commercial, or industrial areas on Local Service Traffic Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as City Walkways or Off-Street Paths, with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Walkways.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Local Service Walkways.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="bicycle-classification-descriptions">Bicycle Classification Descriptions</h2>
<h3 id="major-city-bikeways">Major City Bikeways</h3>
<p>Major City Bikeways form the backbone of the city’s bikeway network and are intended to serve high volumes of bicycle traffic and provide direct, seamless, efficient travel across and between transportation districts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Major City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Major City Bikeways should be designed to accommodate large volumes of bicyclists, to maximize their comfort and to minimize delays by emphasizing the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on Major City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after performing careful analysis to determine potential impacts to the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On Major City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines. Where conditions warrant and where practical, Major City Bikeways should have separated facilities for bicycles and pedestrians.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=""></h3>
<h3 id="city-bikeways">City Bikeways</h3>
<p>City Bikeways are intended to establish direct and convenient bicycle access to significant destinations, to provide convenient access to Major City Bikeways and to provide coverage within three city blocks of any given point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types and residential neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> City Bikeways emphasize the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after taking into consideration the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-bikeways">Local Service Bikeways</h3>
<p>Local Service Bikeways are intended to serve local circulation needs for bicyclists and provide access to adjacent properties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as City Bikeways or Major City Bikeways with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Bikeways.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Consider the following design treatments for Local Service Bikeways: shared roadways, traffic calming, bicycle lanes, and extra-wide curb lanes. Crossings of Local Service Bikeways with other rights-of-way should minimize conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>On-Street Parking:</strong> On-street parking on Local Service Bikeways should not be removed to provide bicycle lanes.</p>
<p><strong>Operation:</strong> Treatment of Local Service Bikeways should not have a side effect of creating, accommodating, or encouraging automobile through-traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bicycle-districts">Bicycle Districts</h3>
<p>Bicycle Districts are areas with a dense concentration of commercial, cultural, institutional and/or recreational destinations where the City intends to make bicycle travel more attractive than driving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> High density and mixed-use neighborhoods should be targeted as bicycle districts. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged in Bicycle Districts.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The size and configuration of a Bicycle District should be consistent with the scale of bicycling trips. A Bicycle District includes the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> All streets within a Bicycle District are important in serving bicycle trips. Appropriate bicycle facilities should be determined for each street based on the desired bicycling conditions and operations. Use the bikeway design and engineering guidelines to design streets within Bicycle Districts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="transit-classification-descriptions">Transit Classification Descriptions</h2>
<p>Maintain a system of transit streets that supports the movement of transit vehicles for regional, interdistrict, and local trips.</p>
<h3 id="regional-transitways">Regional Transitways</h3>
<p>Regional Transitways are intended to facilitate regional and interdistrict transit trips with fast and reliable service over long distances, operating in right-of-way exclusively reserved for transit use to the extent possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Development with a regional attraction (e.g., shopping centers, arenas) are encouraged to locate adjacent to Regional Transitway stations to reduce traffic impacts on adjoining areas and streets. Locate high-density development within a half-mile of transit stations on Regional Transitways, with the highest densities closest to the stations.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> Transit stations should be designed to accommodate a high level of safe multimodal access within a half-mile radius of the station. Provide convenient connection opportunities at Regional Transitway stations when feasible, including feeder bus service, bike-share stations, secure bicycle parking, pick-up and drop-off zones, and shuttle services. Use park-and-ride facilities to access Regional Transit stations only at ends of Regional Transitways or where adequate feeder bus service is not feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use transit-preferential treatments to facilitate fast and reliable transit operations. Provide signal preemption or transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stations or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Provide exclusive or semi-exclusive transitways wherever possible, including treatments on freeways and expressways such as transit lanes, HOV lanes, HOT lanes, and “bus on shoulder” operations. Employ access management measures to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles. Right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures and improve access to transit. Carefully consider any street design changes to Regional Transitways that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.</p>

<h3 id="major-transit-priority-streets">Major Transit Priority Streets</h3>
<p>Major Transit Priority Streets facilitate the frequent and reliable movement of transit vehicles that connect Central City, regional centers, and town centers with each other and to other major destinations. Major Transit Priority Streets are provided frequent service, or are expected to receive that level of service in the future to support envisioned growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Transit-oriented land uses should be encouraged to locate along Major Transit Priority Streets, especially in centers. Discourage auto-oriented develop­ment from locating on a Major Transit Priority Street, except where the street is outside the Central City, center, station community, or main street and is also classified as a Major City Traffic Street. Support land use densi­ties that vary directly with the existing and planned capacity of transit service.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> Provide safe and convenient access for pedestrians and bicyclists to, across, and along Major Transit Priority Streets. Provide safe and accessible pedestrian crossings at all transit stops along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Provide transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stops or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Consider the use of exclusive or semi-exclusive transit lanes where needed to reduce congestion-related transit delay. Design intersections of Major Transit Priority Streets with other Major Transit Priority Streets or Transit Access Streets to allow turning movements of a standard transit vehicle. Where compatible with adjacent land use designations, right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures or improve access to transit. The use of access manage­ment should be considered where needed to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles.Carefully consider any street design changes to Major Transit Priority Streets that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.</p>

Existing speed bumps on Secondary Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.</p>

<h3 id="minor-emergency-response-streets">Minor Emergency Response Streets</h3>
<p>Minor Emergency Response Streets are intended to serve primarily the shorter legs of emergency response trips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as Major Emergency Response Streets or Secondary Emergency Response Streets are classified as Minor Emergency Response Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Design and operate Minor Emergency Response Streets to allow access to individual properties by emergency response vehicles, but maintain livability on the street.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Minor Emergency Response Streets are eligible for all types of traffic slowing devices.</p>

<h2 id="traffic-classification-descriptions">Traffic Classification Descriptions</h2>
<p>Maintain a system of traffic streets that support the movement of motor vehicles for regional, city, district, neighborhood, and local trips. For each type of traffic classification, the majority of motor vehicle trips on a street should conform to its classification description.</p>
<h3 id="regional-trafficways">Regional Trafficways</h3>
<p>Regional Trafficways are intended to serve regional traffic movement that has only one trip end in a City of Portland transportation district or to serve trips that bypass a district completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Regional Trafficways should make safety the highest priority. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Regional Trafficways to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Regional Trafficways should serve the Central City, regional centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities and should connect key freight routes within the region to points outside the region.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Regional Trafficways should connect to other Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, and District Collectors. A ramp that connects to a Regional Trafficway is classified as a Regional Trafficway from its point of connection up to its intersection with a lower-classified street. At ramps and along access streets, accommodate safe multimodal movements.</p>
<p><strong>Buffering:</strong> Adjacent neighborhoods should be buffered from the impacts of Regional Trafficways.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> A street with dual Regional Trafficway and Major City Traffic Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major City Traffic Street and respond to adjacent land uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="major-city-traffic-streets">Major City Traffic Streets</h3>
<p>Major City Traffic Streets are intended to serve as the principal routes for interdistrict traffic that has at least one trip end within a City of Portland transportation district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Major City Traffic Streets. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Major City Traffic Streets to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes for all modes. Major City Traffic Streets should provide separation between motor vehicles and people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices, and provide safe multimodal crossings to destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Major City Traffic Streets should provide motor vehicle connections among the Central City, regional centers, town centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Auto-oriented development should locate adjacent to Major City Traffic Streets, except within designated centers, main streets, station areas, and other areas with high pedestrian demand.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Major City Traffic Streets should serve as primary connections to Regional Trafficways and serve major activity centers in each district. Traffic with no trip ends within a City of Portland transportation district should be discouraged from using Major City Traffic Streets. Where a Major City Traffic Street intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>On-Street Parking:</strong> On-street parking may be removed and additional right-of-way purchased to provide adequate traffic access when consistent with the street design designation of the street. Evaluate the need for on-street parking to serve adjacent land uses and improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists when making changes to the roadway.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="traffic-access-streets">Traffic Access Streets</h3>
<p>Traffic Access Streets are intended to provide access to Central City destinations, distribute traffic within a Central City sub-district, provide connections between Central City subdistricts, and distribute traffic from Regional Trafficways and Major City Traffic Streets for access within the district. Traffic Access Streets are not intended for through-traffic with no trip ends in the district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Traffic Access Streets. Traffic Access Streets should provide frequent, safe crossings for people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Traffic Access Streets serve Central City land uses. Traffic management on Traffic Access Streets must accommodate the high-density pattern desired in the Central City.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Connections to adjoining transportation districts should be to District or Neighborhood Collectors. Intersections of Traffic Access Streets and other streets with higher or similar classifications should be signalized, where warranted, to facilitate the safe movement of traffic along each street as well as turning movements from one street to the other.</p>
<p><strong>Access:</strong> Reduction in motor vehicle congestion is given less priority than: supporting pedestrian access and enhancing the pedestrian environment; maintaining on-street parking to support land uses; accommodating transit; or accommodating bicycles. Access to off-street parking is allowed and encouraged to be located on Traffic Access Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Traffic Access Streets, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="district-collectors">District Collectors</h3>
<p>District Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets to streets of the same or lower classification or to serve trips that both start and end within a district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on District Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be employed to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> District Collectors generally connect town centers, corridors, main streets, and neighborhoods to nearby regional centers and other major destinations. Land uses that attract trips from the surrounding neighbor­hoods or from throughout the district should be encouraged to locate on District Collectors. Regional attractors of traffic such as major shopping centers or arenas should be discouraged from locating on District Collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> District Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, other collectors, and local streets and, where necessary, to Regional Trafficways. Where a District Collector intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on District Collectors, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="neighborhood-collectors">Neighborhood Collectors</h3>
<p>Neighborhood Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets or District Collectors to Local Service Streets or to serve trips that both start and end within areas bounded by Major City Traffic Streets and District Collectors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Neighborhood Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be implemented on Neighborhood Collectors to address identified safety risks. Neighborhood Collectors should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Neighborhood Collectors should connect neighborhoods to nearby centers, corridors, station communities, main streets, and other nearby destinations. New land uses and major expansions of land uses that attract a significant volume of traffic from outside the neighborhood should be discour­aged from locating on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Neighborhood Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, and other Neighborhood Collectors, as well as to Local Service Streets. Where a Neighborhood Collector intersects with a higher-classified street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Calming:</strong> Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability, when consistent with other street classifications.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> The design of Neighborhood Collectors may vary over their length as the land use character changes from primarily commercial to primarily residential. All Neighborhood Collectors should be designed to operate as neighborhood streets and through traffic should be discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-traffic-streets">Local Service Traffic Streets</h3>
<p>Local Service Traffic Streets are intended to distribute local traffic and provide access to local residences or commercial uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Discourage auto-oriented land uses from using Local Service Traffic Streets as their primary access.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Streets that allow motor vehicles and are not classified as Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, Traffic Access Streets**,** District Collectors, or Neighborhood Collectors are classified as Local Service Traffic Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets should connect neighborhoods, provide local circulation, and provide access to nearby centers, corridors, station areas, and main streets. Street segments may be closed to through traffic in some cases as long as local access and overall neighborhood connectivity is maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Calming:</strong> Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability or if needed to support a neighborhood greenway.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets provide local access and circulation for traffic, while often functioning as through routes for pedestrians and bicyclists. In some instances where vehicle speeds and volumes are very low, Local Service Traffic Streets may accommodate vehicles**,** pedestrians**,** and bicyclists in a shared space.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="master-street-plans">Master Street Plans</h1>
<p>The purpose of the master street plans is to increase the efficiency of the transportation system through increased street connectivity and a finer mesh of pedestrian and bikeways. A dense grid of streets helps spread local vehicle trips more evenly over the local street network and reduces congestion on the arterial system. Studies show that improved local street connectivity improves arterial system capacity by as much as 25 percent.<br>
<br>
Studies show that distance is one of the most important factors in mode choice. The lack of a dense grid of streets and pedestrian/bicycle connections results in out-of-direction travel that is particularly discouraging to potential pedestrians and bicyclists. The result is increased use of the automobile for trips to nearby (as the crow flies) destinations. Trips need to be relatively short and direct to encourage travel on foot or by bicycle.<br>
<br>
Good street connectivity improves emergency response times. Police, fire, and ambulance services can reach their destinations more quickly because there is less out-of-direction travel. Multiple access routes can reduce travel times and provide access options if one route is blocked.</p>
<p>Good local street connections can reduce traffic volumes on other streets by spreading traffic over a denser network. With more intersections, traffic also moves more slowly because side street traffic and stop signs discourage drivers from speeding.</p>
<p>As properties are subdivided and developed, access needs are met primarily through new streets. The City’s local street network has grown over time, as outlying areas became more urbanized or older areas are redeveloped. In the past, development was not always required to address connections to adjacent areas as well as internal circulation. The result has been large areas of the City with poor connectivity, particularly in newer areas where the counties previously regulated development.</p>
<p><strong>State Requirements</strong><br>
<br>
Street connectivity must be part of transportation system plans (TSPs) and adopting Ordinances. The Oregon Administrative Rule for State Land Use Goal 12, Transportation, Section 660-012-0020, Elements of Transportation Systems Plans, requires:<br>
<br>
A road plan for a system of arterials and collectors and standards for the layout of local streets and other important non-collector street connections… The standards for the layout of local streets shall provide for safe and convenient bike and pedestrian circulation necessary to carry out OAR 660-012-045(3)(b).<br>
<br>
The State Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) states that the intent of the requirement is to provide guidance on the spacing of future extensions and connections along existing and future streets that are needed to provide reasonably direct routes for bicycle and pedestrian travel.<br>
The rule referenced above goes on to state:<br>
<br>
On-site facilities shall be provided which accommodate safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access from within new subdivisions, multi-family developments, planned developments, shopping centers, and commercial districts to adjacent residential areas and transit stops, and to neighborhood activity centers within one-half mile of the development. Single-family residential developments shall generally include streets and accessways. Pedestrian circulation through parking lots should generally be provided in the form of accessways.<br>
<br>
The TPR also states that local jurisdictions should establish their own standards or criteria for providing streets and accessways consistent with the intent stated above. This may be accomplished through standards for spacing of streets or accessways, and standards for excessive out-of-direction travel. The TPR defines ‘safe and convenient’ access as being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reasonably free from hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting the needs of cyclists and pedestrians, considering destination and length of trip</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metro Requirements</strong><br>
<br>
The Regional Transportation Function Plan (RTFP), adopted in 2010 (Ordinance 10-1241B) and updated in 2012 requires jurisdictions to implement two types of street plans:<br>
\</p>
<ol>
<li>Conceptual street plans that:<br>
<br>
Map contiguous areas of vacant and redevelopable parcels of five or more acres planned or zoned for residential or mixed-use development<br>
Identify appropriate connections to adjacent areas</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate opportunities to extend and connect to existing streets, provide direct public right-of-way routes, and limit the potential of cul-de-sac and other closed-end street designs</li>
</ul>
<p>2. A street map for new residential or mixed-use development that will require construction of a new street(s) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Responds to and expands on the conceptual street plan map</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides for street connections no further apart than 530 feet, except where prevented by barriers such as topography, railroads, freeways, pre-existing development, or water features where regulations do not allow construction of or prescribe different standards for streets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides bicycle and/or pedestrian connections when full street connections are not possible, no further apart than 330 feet, except where prevented by barriers as noted above</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limits the use of cul-de-sac or closed street systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes street cross-sections</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Areas Meeting Connectivity Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Many areas of Portland meet the RTP connectivity standards or are not required to have master street plans. The district maps in Chapter 2 of the TSP (Maps 11.11.9-11.11.16) show these areas. Areas not required to meet connectivity standards include industrial sanctuaries, open space, and protected environmental areas. In Portland these are areas zoned IG1, IG2, IH, OS, and p.</p>
<h2 id="existing-master-street-plans">Existing Master Street Plans</h2>
<h3 id="southwest-and-far-southeast">Southwest and Far Southeast</h3>
<p>The City completed master street plans for the Southwest and Far Southeast transportation districts in June 2001. These two master street plans satisfy the State and regional requirements to identify the location and type of new local street connections. The methodology and criteria used to develop the plans are described briefly below. The SW and Far SE Master Street Plan – Final Report and Recommendations contains quarter-section level maps and tables that detail the recommended connections. The report identifies three objectives to be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduce the uncertainty in the development review process regarding when and where new street connections will be an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for better coordination of the local street system development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comply with the mandates of the State Transportation Planning Rule and Regional Transportation Plan for street connectivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Southwest and Far Southeast master street plans were developed through a number of steps, with mapping associated with each step:</p>
<p>**<br>
**<em>Step One</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define blocks in the study area that meet the spacing standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define areas being excluded (areas where streets are complete or underway; parcels zoned as park, open space, or industrial; religious or educational institutions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Step Two</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define remaining areas that have development or redevelopment potential (land value greater than improvement value; different Comprehensive Plan and zoning designations; two-acre or larger parcels).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define development constraints (street spacing not met, but parcels don’t meet development potential).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Step Three</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Define blocks with barriers to connectivity (environmentally constrained).</li>
</ul>
<p>*Step Four *</p>
<ul>
<li>Group the remaining areas into focus areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Step Five *</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define locations of new connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine specificity of connections – specific points or along a block face).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply type of connection – street or pedestrian/bicycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan’s recommendations include information about the location, level of alignment specificity, type of connection, barriers, presence of environmental zones, traffic impacts, field notes, and comments from the public or technical staff.</p>
<p>While the master street plans identify a number of future connections, the absence of a connection does not mean a connection is not needed or feasible. All areas within the study areas are still subject to relevant policy and spacing standards.</p>
<h3 id="area-specific-master-street-plans"><strong>Area-Specific Master Street Plans</strong></h3>
<p>Street plans have been completed, but not adopted into the Comprehensive Plan, for other areas of the City over the past several years. Although they are not specifically intended to meet the<br>
<br>
State and regional requirements, they do function as master street plans. These plans cover the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gateway Regional Center</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Airport Way (Columbia Corridor)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridgeton (Northeast district adjacent to Marine Drive)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>South Portland (west end of the Ross Island Bridge)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each plan or study is summarized below, along with maps derived from the original documents.<br>
<br>
<strong>Areas Not Covered by Master Street Plans</strong><br>
<br>
Master Street plans have not been completed for all or parts of the North, Northeast, Far Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Central City districts. Other areas were excluded from the Southwest and Far Southeast Master Street Plans: the east light rail corridor (102nd to the city limits, NE Glisan to SE Stark), the Hillsdale town center, and the West Portland town center. Master Street plans for these areas will be completed as refinement plans of the TSP. Until such plans are completed, the location and implementation of new street and pedestrian/bicycle connections will be governed by Title 17: Public Improvements, and Title 33: Planning and Zoning, requirements in City Code. Title 17 regulations govern developing or redeveloping sites that do not include a land division, and Title 33 regulations govern developing or redeveloping sites that do include a land division. The spacing standards in each title are 530 feet for full street connections and 330 feet for pedestrian/bicycle connections where full street connections are not feasible.</p>
<h3 id="south-waterfront-district-street-plan-criteria-and-standards">SOUTH WATERFRONT DISTRICT STREET PLAN, CRITERIA AND STANDARDS</h3>
<p>Background<br>
<br>
In 1996, the Portland City Council accepted the City Engineer’s Report titled North Macadam District Street Plan, which identified and classified a street system for the North Macadam District. On January 20, 2003, City Council adopted amendments to the Central City Plan and updated the District’s special design guidelines and the zoning code. At the same time, City Council changed the North Macadam District name to South Waterfront District (the District). By authority of the City Engineer under Title 17 City Code, the South Waterfront Street Plan, Criteria and Standards was amended in 2007 providing updated design criteria and standard details for the District’s public rights-of-way. The 2009 document update amends the North District (the area south of Sheridan St and north of Gibbs St) rights-of-way alignment and standards to accommodate future light rail and property development, as well as expanded streetcar service and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.<br>
<br>
The South Waterfront District of the Central City of Portland lies along the Willamette River and south of downtown. The district boundaries are the River, Interstate 5, the Marquam Bridge and SW Hamilton Court. Adopted City policy envisions this as a mixed-use neighborhood with significant residential development along the River and commercial development focused along transit corridors. With just over one mile of River frontage the District contains approximately 140 acres. Some land is developed or being developed and some land is vacant land or has redevelopment potential.<br>
<br>
The primary development constraint in the District is transportation access to and from regional highway and transit systems. The South Waterfront Plan of January 20, 2003 includes a vision, policies and an Urban Design Plan that promotes high density housing and commercial development with a full range of businesses that contribute to the region’s job growth. The vision also includes frequent public connections to the river, limiting the size and amount of surface parking lots, and integrating development and services.\</p>
<p><img src="/img/media/image7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In 1998 the North Macadam District Street Design Standards and Criteria Plan: Transportation Report considered and analyzed South Waterfront’s limited access and adjacency to I-5 and Ross Island Bridge ramps. The analysis included the three district portal intersections: River Parkway and Harbor Drive (north), Curry and Macadam (center) and Bancroft and Macadam (south). The analysis was based on the District’s 20-year goals for accommodating 10,000 jobs and 3,000 housing units and a 30 percent mode split. The housing goal has since been increased to 5,000 units.</p>
<p>Conclusions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bancroft and Macadam portal improvements would accommodate traffic growth and transit access at acceptable levels of service. South Waterfront (North Macadam District) became part of the Central City in 1988.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving the central portal from Gibbs to Curry and improving the Curry and Macadam intersection would better accommodate traffic operation, growth and access from I-5 to the District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the District’s growth nears 10,000 jobs and 5,000 housing units, portal access will degrade and as a result function at a marginally acceptable level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>River Parkway and Harbor Drive would operate at acceptable levels although backups on I-5 and Naito Parkway could interfere with operations on a more frequent basis in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 1998 transportation analysis demonstrated that while the District will experience increased congestion over time, the portal capacity with the identified portal improvements and increased transit service should continue to provide acceptable levels of service to the District and the regional transportation system.</p>
<p>Since the 1998 report, plans for portal improvements have been altered. Through the South Portal Study, conducted in 2006, the recommended south portal shifted south to Hamilton St and Macadam. In addition, the planned central portal improvements at Curry have been scaled back and north portal improvements at River Parkway and Harbor Drive have been added. In fact, in 2009 the Portland Bureau of Transportation updated the technical analysis through the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy (resolution no. 36696 adopted April 8, 2009). The report identified multi-modal project priorities and a funding strategy to guide project implementation necessary to support continued development of the urban renewal area, including portal improvements.</p>
<p>The 2007 update of the South Waterfront District Street Plan, Criteria and Standards primarily responded to development in the Central District and completion of infrastructure projects, including the Portland Streetcar extension to Lowell St and the Portland Aerial Tram to Oregon Health Sciences University. Transportation studies, such as the 2004 South Waterfront District Transportation Improvements Evaluation and 2006 South Portal Study had also been completed. Major updates included changes to the street lighting design standards, certain street furniture standards, and the modification of the street plan based on the recommendations of the South Portal Study and the new Greenstreet Policy (resolution no. 36500 adopted in April of 2007). Other changes included modest refinements to various street dimensional standards developed through preliminary engineering and construction of these streets and to refinements of various performance criteria. Overview South Waterfront</p>
<p>2009 Update</p>
<p>Since the 2007 update, the City of Portland has endorsed the locally Preferred Alternative (LPA) for the Portland to Milwaukie Light Rail alignment. This alignment extended light rail south into the North District and include bus service and streetcar utilizing the same alignment. In addition, the OHSU Schnitzer Campus master plan and the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy report, with a prioritized list of multi-modal projects and a funding strategy, have been completed. These activities generated the need to refine and update various elements of the Street Plan. Major updates include changes to the street alignments and designations in the Concept Street Plan Map, updates of some street widths in the Right-of-WayWidth Map changes to street descriptions in the Street Classification and Function Table, and adjustments to the Standard Street Sections.</p>
<p>Specific changes made to the Concept Street Plan map are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bond Ave extends north through the District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bond Ave is one-way northbound through the District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moody Ave is one-way southbound for vehicular traffic through the District; and one-way southbound for streetcar south of Woods St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moody Ave remains two-way streetcar north of Woods St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moody Ave includes a two-way bike path along the west-side to minimize bike/streetcar interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grades of Moody Ave and Porter St are raised to a level consistent with the Willamette River Crossing Partnership findings necessary for light rail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Porter St carries light rail, streetcar and bus in two directions only; private vehicles are not accommodated on this street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>River Pkwy (south of the Marquam Bridge) terminates at Woods St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alignments are adjusted for local east-west streets north of Gibbs St.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Special Design Area” beneath the Ross Island Bridge has been relocated to reflect the location of the potential active-use park. Grover St is aligned on either side of the Ross Island Bridge.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="gateway-regional-center-street-plan">GATEWAY REGIONAL CENTER STREET PLAN</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The 2040 Growth Concept identifies the Gateway regional center as the only regional center in Portland. Planning for Gateway began with the Outer Southeast Community Plan and continued with the Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy. City Council accepted Opportunity Gateway in February 2000 (Resolution No. 35867). The Outer Southeast Community Plan resulted in a plan district and transit-supportive zoning</p>
<p>The Central Gateway portion of the Gateway District Master Street Plan was amended in 2009. This amendment was based on a recommendation in the Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy, which was adopted by the Portland Development Commission in August 2007. The Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy concluded that the street plan for Central Gateway should be updated, with the goal of increasing connectivity in Central Gateway, providing greater certainty to developers about street requirements and opening up parcels to redevelopment.</p>
<p><strong>Street Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>A discontinuous network of streets and sidewalks, high volumes of through-traffic, and underutilized property characterize Gateway regional center. Access to the transit stations in Gateway’s northwest corner and at 102^nd^ and Burnside is problematic. Discontinuous streets discourage walking and bicycling, resulting in significant out-of-direction travel for all modes.</p>
<p>Increasing street connectivity would disperse trips among many alternate routes, thereby reducing congestion, shortening trip lengths, and increasing the mode split for alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<p>Concept Plan Map</p>
<p>The Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy is intended to serve as the ‘appropriate vision’ for the redevelopment of Gateway as a regional center. The concept plan map is a picture of the regional center’s redevelopment potential and build-out in 2019. While the plan map affixes buildings and parks to specific locations, the reality is that new construction will appear somewhat differently. While new streets and connections are identified, they are also subject to change to respond to development opportunities. The Opportunity Gateway report states: &quot;It is rigid enough to be a statement of what is and is not desirable in the</p>
<p>Regional Center, and flexible enough to be useful even as redevelopment circumstances change.&quot; The map graphically depicts the vision described in the report.</p>
<p>The concept plan map calls for a traditional block configuration, which will help unify the regional center’s character. Some of the proposed new connections would greatly change existing circulation patterns. Northeast Multnomah between Fred Meyer’s and Mervyn’s at the Gateway Shopping Center is shown as a fully functional street, intended to help disperse traffic associated with the transit center. In the southern part of the regional center, several new public streets are shown in the Mall 205 and Plaza 205 properties, breaking up what are now large expanses of parking. Pedestrian pathways connect important routes and destinations where full streets are not possible or appropriate, such as between SE 105^th^ and the Adventist Medical Center.</p>
<p>As the major north-south arterial, 102^nd^ Avenue is the spine of the district and is targeted for improvements for all modes. Changes to 99^th^ Avenue would allow it to act as an additional north-south carrier, improving access for development projects and creating a new local identity the length of the district. Major east-west streets (Stark/Washington, Halsey/Weidler, Burnside, and Glisan) will continue to carry significant volumes of through-traffic. Better local north-south street connections will link the two main large shopping areas together, and improved connectivity will be provided within each of these shopping areas.</p>

<p>The Central Gateway Master Street Plan revision was developed to provide flexibility for connections while maintaining larger parcels for redevelopment, recognizing existing parcel lines, provide connections on the local network without altering the district or neighborhood collectors and to foster redevelopment in the City’s only regional Center. Criteria was established for consideration in the proposed plan. Other goals of the plan included aligning streets on parcel boundaries for shared investment in right-of-way improvements; consider common or multiple parcel ownership; minimize parcel impacts and maintain reminder parcels; preserve some large parcels or contiguous ownership parcels; discourage cut-through traffic while providing access; discourage off-set intersections; consider potential spacing of crosswalks or signals.</p>
<p>With these criteria and goals, a revised street plan for Central Gateway was developed. The revised street plan provided needed multi-modal connections within the Central Gateway area without changing the function of the major traffic streets and collectors surrounding the area, such as 102nd Ave., Glisan, Burnside, and Stark.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the revised street plan:</p>
<p>East-west connections between 97th Ave. and 102nd Ave. on Flanders St. and Davis St. North-south connection on 100th Ave. between Oak St. and Burnside and also between Oregon St. and Pacific St.</p>
<p>North–south connection on 101st Ave. between Stark St. and approximately Flanders St., improving multi-modal access to the light-rail station on 102nd and Burnside.</p>
<p>Internal connection on Oregon St. approximately Hoyt St., Coach St., and 101st Ave.</p>
<p>Vacating portions of 97th Ave. to allow developable parcels near I-205. This would continue to allow multi-modal access to the parcels.</p>
<p>Maintaining existing large parcels for development and redevelopment while also providing public bicycle and pedestrian access ways. Large parcels would have the option to have public bike and pedestrian access ways on the site rather than full streets, as was required in the prior master street plan. Public bike and pedestrian access ways will be required on certain blocks such that spacing of public connections shall be no more than 330 feet where full street connections are more than 530 feet. Additionally, pedestrian connections would be required throughout Central Gateway.</p>
<p>Because large parcels were maintained for development and redevelopment, the revised street plan does not include some of the proposed streets that were in the previous in the street plan for the Gateway District. These include:</p>
<p>Extension of Oregon St. between 97th Ave. and 98th Ave. However, the revised street plan proposes to keep the Irving St. alignment as existing between 97th Ave. and 100th Ave., whereas the prior plan showed this segment as vacated.</p>
<p>Full street connection of Hoyt St. between 97th Ave. and 104th Ave.</p>
<p>Full street connection of roughly the Davis St. alignment between 97th Ave. and 103rd Ave. The revised street plan proposes that some portions of the alignment would be full street while other portions would be pedestrian connection.</p>
<p>Extension of 101st Ave. between Washington St. and Pacific St. The revised street plan proposes a mix of full streets and pedestrian connections on some portions of the 101st Ave. alignment. Other portions of the alignment would not have connections. Unlike as in the prior plan, the revised street plan does not intend for 10st Ave. to become a neighborhood collector. Rather, 99th Ave. would be a through street, with 100th Ave. also providing significant connectivity.)</p>
<p>Extension of 100th Ave. between Oak St. and Washington St. (The revised street plan does not include any connectivity at this location. Vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles could access the area from connections at 97th Ave., and 101st.</p>

<h3 id="cully-neighborhood-local-street-plan-2012">Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan (2012)</h3>
<p>The Cully Commercial Corridor and Local Street Plan was adopted by Resolution 36952 in August 2012. Its development was funded by a Transportation Growth Management Grant from the Oregon Department of Transportation. Its recommendations were also influenced by the Portland Plan (April 2012) which had recommendations related to alternative right of way improvements, developing new options for unimproved rights-of-way and accelerating the creation of safe pedestrian connections. The Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan identified new street or pedestrian/bicycle connections to improve street connectivity and address gaps in transportation networks.</p>

<h3 id="far-southeast-portland-master-street-plan">FAR SOUTHEAST PORTLAND MASTER STREET PLAN</h3>
<p><strong>Study Area</strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast Portland Master Street Plan includes nearly all of the Far Southeast Transportation District, from I-205 east to the City limit, and from Burnside south to the City limits. Some portions of this area are excluded from the plan: the Gateway regional center because a street plan already exists, and Burnside light rail station areas (102^nd^ to 162^nd^,</p>
<p>NE Glisan to SE Stark), where master street plans will be completed as part of TSP refinement plans.</p>
<p><strong><em>Land Use</em></strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast is predominantly in residential use, with interspersed commercial/retail uses. Commercial/retail uses are located in strip commercial development along arterials such as 122^nd^ and Division or in malls such as Mall 205 or the San Rafael Shopping Center. Institutions, such as colleges, hospitals, and schools, can create barriers, but offer limited opportunities for street connections. Cemeteries and parks also occupy significant tracts of land in the district. There are only a few pockets of industrial uses, principally near the Lents town center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zoning</em></strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast Master Street Plan Study area includes virtually all of the various City commercial zones, except some designed specifically for the Central City. The area includes nearly all the residential zones, excluding only the most dense zones. The employment and industrial zoning currently in place is confined primarily to the southern edge of the district. Significant tracts of open space zoning exist, with Powell Butte the largest. Environmental overlays are applied to areas with steep slopes and near streams and wetland areas, principally in the southeast portion of the district.</p>
<p>Area Character</p>
<p>Terrain and the density of development largely determine the area’s character. Some less developed areas display a rural appearance, with open fields and large out-buildings. The majority of the district has a more suburban appearance, with large tracts of single-dwelling homes on medium to large lots. Some areas display a more urban character, with smaller lots and buildings closer to the street. Steep slopes with numerous streams and gullies are located in the southern portion of the area, along Johnson Creek and in Pleasant Valley.</p>
<p>Long-term county stewardship, along with recent population growth, has resulted in relatively few public streets in some areas, and large redevelopable parcels of land. Many of the area’s local service streets and collectors are not fully improved. The lack of sidewalks results in a street system that is not particularly pedestrian friendly. The lack of public streets contributes significantly to out-of-direction travel patterns, and very wide major arterials carry many local trips as well as through-trips.</p>
<p><strong>Issues and Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Barriers (such as terrain, streams, and existing development) will continue to limit a connected street system, including bicycle/pedestrian accessways, in Far Southeast Portland. With expected increases in the number of households and dwelling units in the area, however, completion of the local street system will be needed even more to provide multimodal access to areas of new development and from those areas to neighborhood activity centers, transit, and arterials.</p>

<h3 id="outer-powell-blvd-conceptual-plan-design-2012">Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design (2012)</h3>
<p>The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation, in coordination with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), developed a conceptual design plan for Outer SE Powell Blvd. from the I-205 to SE 174th Ave (city limits). This stretch of SE Powell Blvd is designated State Highway No. 26. Therefore, ODOT has jurisdiction along SE Powell Blvd.</p>
<p>The plan addressed the needs for Outer Powell Blvd in a 20-year time frame. The plan identified improvements and right-of-way width needs that will allow Outer SE Powell Blvd to serve vehicle traffic movement while also improving the safety, accessibility and the aesthetic environment for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders. The Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design was adopted by Resolution 36931 in February 2013.</p>
<p>A component of the plan was improving local connectivity around Powell Blvd. A Local Streets and Access-ways Report identified additional connections in the area.</p>
<p>Six types of connections were identified in the Local Streets and Accessways Report.</p>
<p>Separated In-Roadway Bicycle Facilities. Facilities that separate the bicycle travel lane from the motor vehicle lane with striping or a physical barrier. Examples are a standard bike lane, buffered bike lane, and cycle track.</p>
<p>Bicycle Boulevards/Advisory Bike Lanes. Facilities on low traffic volume streets where through movements of bicycles is given priority over motor vehicles Advisory bike lanes include dashed bike lane striping and single motor vehicle lane. Vehicles are allowed to enter bike lanes to pass each other.</p>
<p>Pedestrian and Bicycle Pathways. These facilities are outside of the roadway right-of way and fully separated from the roadway.</p>
<p>Street Connections. New local streets built to City standards. Sidewalks accommodate pedestrian travel and bike travel share the roadway with vehicles.</p>
<p>Pedestrian and Bicycle Crossings. Two types of crossings were identified. The first type is provided by the existing traffic signals. New signals were not recommended. The second crossing type is shown at generally desired locations between signalized intersections. Specific design treatments were not determined (e.g. pedestrian refuge island, HAWK signal, etc.)</p>
<p>Potential Street Realignment. Opportunities to realign existing streets through future redevelopment. The objective is to align intersections on opposite sides of Powell Boulevard to improve pedestrian crossings or access to transit stops.</p>
<h3 id="division-midway-neighborhood-street-plan">Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan</h3>
<p>(Adopted by Resolution No. 37157 October 15, 2015)</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), in partnership with the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), developed the Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan. The Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan was developed to help improve local street and pathway connectivity in several East Portland neighborhoods. The project area is centered on SE Division Street, a designated “Main Street” in the Metro Region 2040 Growth Concept Plan and the study area was bounded by SE 112th Ave, SE 148th Ave, SE Stark and SE Holgate and includes portions of the Hazelwood, Mill Park, Centennial and Powellhurst Gilbert neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Goals and Objectives: The overall goal is to develop a Neighborhood Street Plan that can better increase street connectivity and multi-modal travel options within the project area. Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establish a more connected local street and path network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create safer walking and bicycling routes to neighborhood destinations, transit and the regionally designated SE Division Main Street</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the range of options for improving local streets, including use of Portland Street By Street design options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform future improvements to be built over-time by property owners, developers and the City.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Street Plan identified implementation methods for introducing new street and pathway connections and options for improving deficient local streets. The plan recommended adding New Future Public Connections across Existing Private Property.</p>

<h3 id="tryon-stephens-headwaters-neighborhood-street-plan">Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</h3>
<p>(Adopted by Resolution No. 37162, November 2015)</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) and the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) developed the Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan to create a strategy to complete the transportation network and stormwater system within the study area. The Tryon-Stephens plan provides a strategy for enhancing neighborhood access to local destinations by looking comprehensively at street and drainage issues. The Tryon-Stephens Street Plan sets a framework for tailoring improvements to individual streets based on the adjacent land use, street character, and natural setting.</p>
<p>The plan recommends modifying the City of Portland’s Southwest Master Street Plan (2001) to add future local street/pathway connections in two locations within the study area, as shown on the following map (page 52 of the Tryon-Stevens plan). Recommended new connections are in the Hillsdale neighborhood linking SW Nevada Court to SW Vermont Street between SW 26th Avenue and Capitol Hill Road, and in the Markham Neighborhood linking SW Marigold Street between SW 23rd and SW 26th Avenues.</p>

<p><strong>TriMet Service Enhancement Plans</strong></p>
<p>PBOT worked with Trimet, riders, residents, neighborhood groups, governments, schools and businesses to plan improvements to transit service. The long-term vision developed identifies and prioritizes opportunities to improve bus service as well as pedestrian and bike access to transit.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.trimet.org/category/service-enhancement-plans/">[http://news.trimet.org/category/service-enhancement-plans/]{.underline}</a></p>
<p><strong>Growing Transit Communities Plan (GTC)</strong></p>
<p>The Growing Transit Communities Plan is an effort to identify and prioritize the most beneficial improvements that would make getting to the bus and using the bus, a safer and more convenient option along sections of 3 bus lines 87, 77, and 20. The purpose of the GTC Plan) s to determine a package of transportation investments on a corridor level that would best create transit-oriented neighborhoods, places where transit (along with walking and bicycling for short trips) is truly the mode of choice for getting to and from work, school, shops, or other destinations. Frequent transit service is one essential component of a transit-oriented community, but other components include safe access to transit, bus stop quality, sidewalk and bikeway network connections, crossings of busy streets, and the overall built environment. Deficiencies in these other factors often lead to lower ridership, and make frequent service less viable to implement.</p>
<p>The Portland Plan and the Climate Action Plan have established a mode split goal of 25% of all trips on transit by 2035, and the 2035 Regional Transportation Plan includes a goal of tripling transit mode share over 2005 levels. Increasing transit service frequency and targeted investments in access to transit are ways to increase transit ridership. Implementation of this Plan will help the City reach these policy goals and accommodate future growth.</p>
<p>Data from Metro’s 2011 Travel Activity Survey indicates that 6.6% of trips in Portland are currently on transit, increasing only 20% between 1994 and 2011. Additional support for transit is needed, as the current growth trend is not aggressive enough to meet mode share targets and accommodate the transportation needs of expected population and employment growth. The Comprehensive Plan, prioritizes transit-oriented centers and corridors to accommodate expected population and employment growth while minimizing traffic growth. TriMet developed its Service Enhancement Plans to present long-term visions for the future development of the transit system. These two planning efforts combined work together to provide high-frequency and high-capacity transit to areas identified for high-density residential and employment land uses. This coordination results in a concentration of compact, 20-minute neighborhoods where transit is the mode of choice for longer trips to other parts of the City or region.</p>
<p>Transit and higher density zoning alone are not sufficient to produce the levels of development and transit use to meet regional goals. Without safe pedestrian and bicycle access to transit, high-quality transit stops, fast and reliable transit operations, parking management, and effective demand management, the automobile will likely be the preferred mode. TriMet’s future investment and improving and expanding the frequent transit network will be prioritized based on the level of local access investments, transit-supportive policies, and priority treatments. TriMet and the City will work together to update corridors with transit-supportive investments to help support both frequent transit service and transit-oriented development. Targeted investments in access to transit, stop amenities, transit priority treatments, and demand management are ways to increase transit ridership. This project will help the City reach the adopted Climate Action Plan goal of achieving a 25% transit mode share by 2035. Making early investments before anticipated development will ensure future residents and employees find transit to be an attractive travel choice when they are moving or changing jobs and are most receptive to a change in mode choice. Transit-supportive investments have additional benefits by improving pedestrian and bicycle networks and enhancing transit service used by a wider population than those who work and live along the corridor. These investments will also help corridors meet TriMet’s criteria for frequent service expansion, allowing the City to leverage investments for increased transit service hours.</p>

<p><strong>Recent Transit Improvements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Streetcar Loop</strong></p>
<p>Since first opening service from NW 23rd Avenue to Portland State University in 2001, PBOT and Portland Streetcar, Inc. have worked together to continuously fine tune and improve the efficiency and reliability of Portland Streetcar. A subcommittee of the Citizen Advisory Committee created a list of projects that could reduce travel times and improve reliability. The next suggestion on the list is the consolidation of stops.</p>
<p><a href="https://portlandstreetcar.org/news/2016/01/track-to-the-future">[https://portlandstreetcar.org/news/2016/01/track-to-the-future]{.underline}</a></p>
<p><strong>Light Rail</strong></p>
<p>The Orange and Green Lines were built to connect to Clackamas Town Center (Green) and Downtown Milwaukee (Orange). The Orange line opened in September 2015 with the addition of the Tilikum Crossing, a bridge that does not accommodate motor vehicles but is for bikes, peds and transit.</p>
<p>**Southwest Corridor Plan (SWC) **</p>
<p>A key part of the Southwest Corridor Plan is a proposed 12-mile MAX light rail line from downtown Portland to Tigard and Bridgeport Village in Tualatin, along with numerous walking, biking and roadway projects to help people access stations. This plan has been created as a partnership of seven cities, Washington County and the Metro Council, along with TriMet and the Oregon Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>The Southwest Corridor Plan includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new 12-mile MAX line from downtown Portland to Tigard and Bridgeport Village in Tualatin <a href="http://www.oregonmetro.gov/public-projects/southwest-corridor-plan/light-rail-study">[Learn more]{.underline}</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roadway, bicycle and pedestrian projects to help people get to transit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A strategy to promote equitable development in the corridor when light rail is constructed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A specific equitable housing strategy for Tigard and Portland along the light rail line</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>Division Transit Project</strong></p>
<p>The Division Transit Project will improve travel between Downtown Portland, Southeast and East Portland and Gresham with easier, faster and more reliable bus service. Metro began planning for the project in 2014 by convening a project Steering Committee and holding a series of public open houses and meetings. Metro transferred project leadership to TriMet on December 20, 2016. The Division Transit Project will include design elements such as improved pedestrian crossings at stations, and coordination with other efforts, such as the City of Portland’s Outer SE Division Near-Term Safety Strategy and the Powell-Division Transit and Development Project (Powell-Division), to make Division safer for all users.</p>

<p><strong>Fareless Square discontinued</strong></p>
<p>Fareless Square was created in 1975 to reduce emissions and auto traffic in the downtown area. In 2010, TriMet voted to eliminate free bus service in Fareless Square, which did cover downtown, Old Town, the convention center and Lloyd Center.</p>
<p><strong>Streetcar plan and extensions</strong></p>
<p>Adopted by Portland City Council on September 9, 2009, the Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan (SSCP) identifies potential corridors that will build upon the success of the existing streetcar system and expand service to best serve Portland’s neighborhoods and business districts. The streetcar is a key element in the city’s plan for more sustainable future growth.</p>
<p><strong>Streetcar System Concept Plan Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan can play a key role in shaping the City by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reinforcing walkable and economically diverse neighborhoods and vibrant main streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging sustainable and equitable development and infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting reduction of vehicle trips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting greater accessibility, housing options, employment, and economic development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Streetcar System Concept Plan Goals</strong></p>
<p>A successful streetcar system will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Help Portland achieve its peak oil and sustainability strategies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an organizing structure and catalyst for Portland’s future growth along streetcar corridors; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate streetcar corridors into Portland’s existing neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Successful streetcar corridors need to:</strong></p>
<p>1. Be a viable transit option with adequate ridership.</p>
<p>2. Have (re)development potential.</p>
<p>3. Demonstrate community support to make the changes necessary for a successful streetcar corridor</p>
<p>The SSCP project has expanded the conversation about streetcar from a downtown incrementally-growing transit mode into citywide strategic economic development tool and neighborhood circulator.</p>

<p><strong>Comp Plan Policies</strong></p>
<p>Comp Plan policies 9.6 and 9.17-19 are pedestrian policies. There are additional policies in Chapter 8, 3 and 4 that address pedestrian infrastructure and services.</p>
<p><strong>Pedestrian Master Plan (PedPDX)</strong></p>
<p>PedPDX is Portland’s citywide pedestrian plan. It will prioritize sidewalk and crossing improvements and other investments to make walking safer and more comfortable across the city. The plan will identify the key strategies and tools we will use to make Portland a truly great walking city.</p>
<p>PedPDX is an update of the <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/index.cfm?a=90244">[1998 Pedestrian Master Plan]{.underline}</a> (PMP). Since 1998, the PMP has guided pedestrian-friendly design and policies in Portland, and has served as a model across the country. The PMP developed a project list that has guided investment over the past 18 years.</p>
<p>There is more we can do to make Portland a great walking city. Despite consistent investment in the pedestrian network, significant gaps and deficiencies remain, and new policy questions have emerged. An incomplete pedestrian network limits the City’s ability to absorb growth and meet the livability and access needs of residents, including safe walking access to public transit and essential services. The 1998 Pedestrian Master Plan has served inner Portland well, but has often struggled to provide adequate guidance for areas such as East Portland and Southwest Portland that present environmental challenges and right-of-way constraints.</p>
<p>PedPDX will reflect changes to pedestrian policy and design best practices that have emerged since the original Pedestrian Master Plan was adopted, including an emerging understanding of transportation equity and a <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/40390">[Vision Zero]{.underline}</a> approach to pedestrian safety. The updated plan will ensure that the City continues to lead the way in walkability, and will allow Portland to absorb growth in a sustainable way that encourages residents to walk, whether for commuting, shopping, going to school, or recreation.</p>
<p>The PedPDX citywide pedestrian plan will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establish a clear plan vision, goals, and objectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify gaps and needs in Portland’s pedestrian network (including needs for new sidewalks, crossings, and other pedestrian improvements)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize needs to ensure that we are directing funding to locations with the greatest needs first (project prioritization will reflect the City’s commitment to improving equity outcomes and reaching our Vision Zero goal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Articulate the strategies, actions, and tools we will use to improve walking conditions within prioritized areas, and across the city</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify context-sensitive design solutions for various part of the city</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the City’s pedestrian classifications and designations, which help drive pedestrian design requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the performance measures we will use to track our progress implementing the plan over time</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Comp Plan policies 9.6 and 9.20 - 9.21 are bicycle policies. There are additional policies in Chapter 8, 3 and 4 that address bicycle infrastructure and services.</p>
<p><strong>Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030 was adopted unanimously by Portland’s City Council on February 11, 2010. The <em>Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030</em> aims to make bicycling a critical component of our city’s overall transportation system and a significant element of our sustainable green economy. More than an update of the 1996 plan, it proposes fundamental changes to city policy, to bikeway design, to the density of our bikeway network and to an array of supporting efforts and programs. The Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030 also identifies the many benefits that will accrue to Portland as a result of its implementation.</p>
<p>Key principles of the <em>Portland Bicycle Plan for 203</em>0:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attract new riders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen bicycle policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form a denser bikeway network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase bicycle parking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand programs to support bicycling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase funding for bicycle facilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bicycling creates safer streets, reduces the causes of global climate change, promotes a healthy environment, and limits the effects and health care costs related to inactivity. It provides equity and access to viable, affordable transportation options and creates fun, vibrant, and livable neighborhoods. It supports Portland’s economy and is a sound investment.</p>

<p><strong>Comp Plan Policies</strong></p>
<p>Comp Plan policies 9.7 and 9.30 - 9.36 are freight policies. There are also freight related policies in Chapter 6: Economic Development.</p>
<p><strong>Freight Master Plan</strong></p>
<p>The City of Portland Freight Master Plan was adopted May 10, 2006 and provided a roadmap for managing freight movement and commercial delivery of goods and services in Portland, today and into the future. The goal is to foster a freight system that works for the community. The Freight Master Plan objectives center around three main themes: mobility, livability, and healthy economy. After 10 years, a new update of the Freight Master Plan is underway.</p>
<p>The Portland area has historically been a center of trade and commerce in the Pacific Northwest and, because of its connections to the interstate highway network, marine and rail terminals and an international airport, is the fourth largest freight hub for domestic and international trade on the west coast; behind the Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco regions.</p>
<p>Portland’s freight hub is characterized by its 12,500 acres of industrial land surrounding the Portland Harbor and the Portland International Airport, which accommodates most of the region’s heavy industrial activities - marine terminals, rail yards, large manufacturing and warehousing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The City of Portland completed its first Transportation System Plan (TSP) in 2002. During this process, the City recognized the need to better understand freight-related issues in order to:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure Portland’s transportation network can support the projected increased demand for freight movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance freight mobility needs with community impacts and other transportation modes (bicycle, pedestrian, transit, auto).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take advantage of economic opportunities and changes in the global economy by capitalizing on Portland’s inherent geographic advantage and existing multimodal freight transportation system (marine, rail, air, highway, pipeline).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the 2002 Port of Portland Commodity Flow Forecast, demand for freight tonnage into, out of, and within the Portland area will grow from 260 million tons with a total value of $352 billion in 1997 to 522 million tons with a combined value of $827 billion by 2030.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The volume of freight tonnage in the Portland area is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.1%. The overall share of freight tonnage by year 2030 is projected to be: Truck (73%), Rail (11%), Ocean and Barge (10%), Pipeline (6%), and Air (&lt;1%).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Does the Freight Master Plan Do?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Freight Master Plan is part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan - the policy guide for City growth and development - and one of the modal elements of the City’s Transportation System Plan, which elevates freight to the same level as the other modal plans (bicycle, pedestrian, motor vehicle, transportation demand management, transit) by addressing the unique characteristics, needs and impacts of freight movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;!-- --&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>Established the Portland Freight Committee, which brought together a diverse group of members representing various multi-modal freight service providers, shippers, trade associations, and businesses involved in freight activities as well as public agency representatives from the local, state, and federal levels. The Portland Freight Committee serves as an advisory group to the Mayor, Portland City Council and the Portland Bureau of Transportation on freight related issues.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The State Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) defines a refinement plan as an amendment to a transportation system plan (TSP) that resolves, at the system level, the function, mode, or general location of a transportation project that was deferred during development of the TSP. A refinement plan is necessary when the detailed information required to address a transportation need could not be determined during the TSP process.</p>
<p>In the context of Portland’s TSP, studies are similar to refinement plans; however, they may not necessarily address a transportation capacity need or their feasibility may not yet be determined. Studies are intended to address issues that have a transportation component identified by the community or other entities.</p>
<p>Metro’s 2010 and 2014 Regional Transportation System Plan (RTP) identified Mobility Corridors and describes a number of plans and includes a number of studies for Portland to conduct to assist with the implementation of the Mobility Corridors. The City has also identified refinement plans and studies through the Comprehensive Plan update and TSP process. This chapter lists (not in order of priority) the refinement plans and studies that either Metro or the City will undertake over the life of the TSP. In some cases, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) will be the lead agency.</p>
<p>The previous TSP contained Chapter 12: Area Plans which was a summary of plans competed. This chapter was deleted as part of the 2035 TSP update. All plans are available on the City’s website.</p>
<p><strong>RTP PLANS AND STUDIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Relating to the Regional Transportation Plan</strong></p>
<p>The 2014 update to the Regional Transportation Plan highlighted seven “Mobility Corridors” throughout the region in which further refinement studies were needed. Of these seven corridors, parts of four corridors were within Portland City limits (RTP Mobility Corridors 2, 4, 8, and 9). The refinement plans in this section address the need for further study as identified in the Regional Transportation Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Refinement Plans</strong></p>
<p><em>The purpose statement for each regional refinement plan and study is taken from the RTP</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Northeast Portland Highway</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Refine long-term improvements to consider additional TSM and access management.</em></p>
<p>Freight movement in the future will rely more heavily on NE Portland Highway (US Highway 30 bypass). This route links the Rivergate marine terminals and Portland Airport terminals to industrial destinations throughout the region. It includes Killingsworth and Lombard Streets from I-205 to Martin Luther King (MLK), Jr. Boulevard, and Columbia Boulevard from MLK Jr. Boulevard to N Burgard.</p>
<p>Although NE Portland Highway appears to have adequate capacity to serve expected 2020 demand, a number of refinements are needed in the corridor. The plan should consider the following transportation approaches:</p>
<p>● Improve NE Portland Highway as a strategy to address Banfield corridor and east Marine Drive congestion.</p>
<p>● Develop a long-term strategy to serve freight movement between Highway 30 and Rivergate.</p>
<p>● Implement access management measures along NE Portland Highway.</p>
<p>● Implement and refine identified Columbia corridor changes to address corridor needs of NE Portland Highway from Rivergate to I-205.</p>
<p>● Consider grade separation at major intersections.</p>
<p>● Streamline the NE Portland Highway connection from the Lombard/Killingsworth section to Columbia Boulevard, with an improvement transition point at MLK, Jr. Boulevard.</p>
<p>● Improve the Columbia Boulevard interchange at I-5 to provide full access to NE Portland Highway.</p>
<p>● Construct capacity and intersection improvements between 82nd Avenue and I-205.</p>
<p>The additional work done through the refinement plan will be based on the Columbia Corridor Study, the St. Johns Truck Strategy, and the environmental assessment for the ‘East End Connector’ transportation project.</p>
<p>Since 2007, two major improvements to the corridor have been completed: the East End Connector and the St. Johns Truck Strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Major Refinement Plans</strong></p>
<p>Major refinement plans are necessary when a transportation need exists, but the mode, function, and general location of a transportation improvement have not been determined, and a range of actions must be considered before identifying a specific project or projects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Highway 99E (McLoughlin Boulevard)/224 Corridor (encompasses RTP Mobility Corridor 10: Portland Central City to Milwaukie)</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Develop a traffic management plan for SE McLoughlin Boulevard from the Ross Island Bridge to I-205.</em></p>
<p>Long-term improvements are needed in this corridor to preserve access between the Central City and Clackamas County, provide access to the Clackamas regional center, and support downtown development in the Milwaukie town center. The recently completed South/North light rail study demonstrated a need for high-capacity transit service in this corridor. Both highway and high-capacity transit service are needed over the 20-year plan period to keep pace with expected growth in this part of the region. This refinement plan should include rapid bus transit service, or its equivalent, in the short term and light rail in the long term. Transportation improvements should address the following approaches:</p>
<p>● Implement access management measures throughout the corridor, including grade separations at intersections along Highway 224 between Harrison Street and I-205.</p>
<p>● Discourage spillover traffic from McLoughlin and Highway 224 onto Tacoma Street, 17^th^ Avenue, Johnson Creek Boulevard, 34^th^ Avenue, and Lake Road.</p>
<p>● Monitor and mitigate spillover traffic from McLoughlin and Highway 224 onto other local collectors.</p>
<p>● Consider a reversible high-occupant vehicle (HOV) lane or peak-period priced lane between Ross Island Bridge and the intersection with Harold Street.</p>
<p>● Expand highway capacity to a total of three general-purpose lanes from Harold Street to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I-205, and consider reversible HOV or peak-period pricing for new capacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>● Provide a more direct transition from McLoughlin to Highway 224 at Milwaukie in order to orient long trips and through-traffic onto Highway 224 and northbound McLoughlin.</p>
<p>● Provide improved transit access to the Milwaukie and Clackamas regional centers.</p>
<p>● Provide improved pedestrian and bicycle access. Include active transportation component to the plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interstate 205 (RTP Mobility Corridors 7 - Tualatin to Oregon City, 8 -Oregon City to Gateway, and 9 - Gateway to Clark County)</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Develop a traffic management plan from I-5 to Clark County.</em></p>
<p>Improvements are needed in the I-205 corridor to address existing deficiencies and expected growth in travel demand in Clark, Multnomah, and Clackamas Counties. The refinement plan should address the following needs and opportunities:</p>
<p>● Provide for some peak-period mobility for longer trips.</p>
<p>● Preserve freight mobility from I-5 to Clark County, with an emphasis on connections to Highway 213, Highway 224, and the Sunrise corridor.</p>
<p>● Maintain an acceptable level of access to the Oregon City, Clackamas, and Gateway regional centers and the Sunrise industrial area.</p>
<p>● Maintain acceptable levels of access to Portland Airport, including air cargo access.</p>
<p>● Use the physical configuration of highway improvements to shape urban form in the City or urban reserve area.</p>
<p>● Provide improved pedestrian and bicycle access. Include active transportation component to the plan.</p>
<p>The plan should consider the following potential transportation changes:</p>
<p>● Auxiliary lanes from Airport Way to I-84 east</p>
<p>● Express lanes, peak-period pricing, or HOV lanes as strategies for expanding capacity</p>
<p>● Relative value of specific ramp, overcrossing, and parallel route improvements</p>
<p>● An eastbound HOV lane from I-5 to the Oregon City Bridge</p>
<p>● A truck climbing lane south of Oregon City</p>
<p>● Rapid bus service from Oregon City to Gateway</p>
<p>● Extension of rapid bus service north from Gateway into Clark County</p>
<p>● Light rail</p>
<p>● Refinements to 2040 land use assumptions for this area to expand potential employment in the area and improve the jobs/housing imbalance</p>
<p>● Reevaluation of the suitability of Beavercreek as an urban reserve area, based on the ability to provide a transportation infrastructure that can adequately serve that area</p>
<p>Metro is dividing the I-205 refinement plan into two segments. The first segment stretches from Highway 224 north to Vancouver and includes the current work being done through the South Transit Corridor Study and the transit part of the I-5 Trade Corridor Study. The second segment is south from Highway 224 and is completely outside Portland’s boundaries.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hayden Island Access</em></strong></p>
<p>In coordination with regional, state and federal partners, develop and evaluate access options to Hayden Island from Marine Drive. Access would include Pedestrian, Bike, Transit, Auto and Freight to support the Hayden Island plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>North Willamette River Crossing</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Study the need for a new bridge from US Highway 30 to Rivergate.</em></p>
<p>Analysis for the RTP showed a strong demand for travel between NE Portland Highway from the Rivergate industrial area and Highway 30/St Helens Road on the west side of the Willamette River. The St. Johns Bridge currently carries this traffic, but has limitations and will not be adequate in the long term to carry freight and other traffic. The St. Johns Truck Strategy recommends a number of changes to balance freight mobility needs with the vitality of the St. Johns town center. The Truck Strategy provides an interim solution to demand in the corridor and does not attempt to address long-term access needs to Rivergate and Highway 30. The refinement plan should incorporate the following:</p>
<p>● Building on the St Johns Truck Strategy, recommendations to provide adequate freight and general access to Rivergate, while considering potentially negative impacts on the future development of the St. Johns town center</p>
<p>● The potential for a “streamlined” northeast Portland connection from I-205 to Rivergate</p>
<p>● A long-term management plan for the St. Johns Bridge if the plan recommends a new crossing</p>
<p>Since 2007, preliminary traffic modeling has been done to show how a new Willamette River crossing north of St Johns would impact truck volumes through the neighborhood. As a part of the St Johns Truck Strategy, access improvements have been made within the St. Johns neighborhood to facilitate freight access.</p>
<p>Additional analysis should look at a new pedestrian/bicycle bridge across the Willamette from Kelley Point to Sauvie Island, a new pedestrian/bicycle path to the North Portland Railroad Bridge, and additional analysis related to the need for a motor vehicle bridge.</p>
<p><strong><em>Powell Boulevard/Foster Road</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Resolve outstanding transportation issues in the Pleasant Valley, Damascus and south Gresham areas.</em></p>
<p>The Powell Boulevard/Foster Road Corridor represents both a key transportation challenge and an opportunity to meet 2040 regional land use goals. The Powell/Foster Corridor is a top priority among corridors requiring refinement plans. Despite policy changes to level-of-service standards that permit greater levels of congestion, significant multimodal improvements will be needed in order to continue to serve transportation needs of the communities and industrial areas in southeast Portland and Gresham. The corridor is also critical to providing access to the planned growth areas in Pleasant Valley, along with Damascus and Springwater that have recently been added to the Urban Growth Boundary. In addition, the corridor is constrained by significant topographical and environmental features.</p>
<p>As a result of the findings from Phase 1 of the Powell Boulevard/Foster Road Corridor Plan, which was completed in 2003, specific multimodal projects have been identified that address transportation needs on Powell Boulevard between inner SE Portland and Gresham, and on Foster Road west of Barbara Welch Road. System level decisions for transit service were also made for the corridor.</p>
<p>Several outstanding transportation problems in the Pleasant Valley, Damascus and south Gresham areas, require additional planning work before specific multimodal projects can be developed and implemented. The Phase 2 plan should be closely coordinated with concept plans for Damascus and the Springwater area, in order to incorporate the updated land use and transportation assumptions. It should examine the following transportation solutions and strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine the appropriate cross-section on Foster Road between Barbara Welch Road and Jenne Road and the project timing, to meet roadway, transit, pedestrian and bike needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore the possibilities for potential new street connection improvements in the Mount Scott area that reduce local travel demand on Foster Road and improve access to the Pleasant Valley area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop conceptual designs and determine right-of-way for an improvement and extension of SE 174^th^ Avenue between Powell Boulevard and Giese Road, or another new north-south roadway in the area, to accommodate travel demand and improve access to Pleasant Valley. The alignment should consider engineering feasibility, land use and environmental effects, safety, and overall costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further define the three-lane Highland Drive and Pleasant View Drive option that was recommended as part of Phase 1. This option needs to address design, operational, and safety-related issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work with local jurisdictions to provide for access management on arterials serving Pleasant Valley and Damascus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address other regional north-south transportation needs identified by the Damascus Concept Plan and Springwater concept planning effort. Further evaluate alignment issues, engineering cost estimates, and right-of-way impacts of future roadway projects north of Damascus that are identified as part of the concept planning effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2007, Gresham and Multnomah County submitted an application for a TGM grant to study the issues identified above; if the grant is approved, the City of Portland has agreed to contribute to complete its portion of the study. Additionally, the Metro East Metro Connection plan explored some of the Powell/Foster concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Portland Central City to Tigard (RTP Mobility Corridor #2 – Southwest Corridor)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Identify needed improvements for motor vehicles, trucks, bicycles, pedestrians, and high-capacity transit travel in the Barbur/I-5 corridor from I-405 to the north Tigard interchange.</em></p>
<p>This corridor provides access to the Central City and to neighborhoods and commercial areas in the inner southwest quadrant of the region. Barbur Boulevard is designated in the RTP as a multimodal facility with potential light rail or rapid bus service, and also serves a regional role for motor vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian systems. I-5 in this corridor is designated as a Main Roadway route for freight and a Principle Arterial for motor vehicles, extending southward beyond the region.</p>
<p>Even with priority system improvements, segments of both Barbur Boulevard and I-5 in this corridor experience significant congestion and poor service levels, especially from the Terwilliger interchange northward. However, high-capacity transit along Barbur and other expanded bus services are expected to experience promising ridership levels. Significant localized congestion occurs along the intersecting street segments of Bertha, Terwilliger, and Capitol Highway/Taylors Ferry. Broad street cross-sections, angled intersections, and limited signalized crossing opportunities along Barbur create traffic safety hazards and inhibit walking to local destinations and access to transit services.</p>
<p>The I-5 right-of-way presents a substantial barrier to local street system connectivity, contributing to congestion at the limited number of crossing points. The relatively steep freeway grade presents a safety hazard and contributes to significant roadway noise impacts on adjacent neighborhoods. The corridor is also located in the vicinity of several significant natural resource areas, including the Stephens Creek, Fanno Creek and Tryon Creek watersheds.</p>
<p>Several recent planning studies and actions will provide guidance for future transportation analyses and refinement planning. The South Portland Circulation Study report provides a circulation concept for the Ross Island bridgehead area and Naito Parkway. The Barbur Boulevard Streetscape Plan provides guidance for pedestrian and streetscape improvements. The Barbur Concept Plan also provides guidance. The West Portland Town Center Study recommends various transportation improvements for this area. The City did not adopt or act upon this study, but some portions may be useful for future considerations.</p>
<p>The adoption of the Southwest Community Plan and Comprehensive Plan (SWCP) and Zoning Map resolved many land use issues in the broader area surrounding the corridor. However, a ‘Barbur envelope’ has been delineated for a future land use and transportation planning process. This area includes a relatively narrow band of properties along Barbur between Miles Street and the City boundary and in the general area of the West Portland town center. Until the plan for this area is completed, the SWCP identifies the town center designation as conceptual only; the exact designation for the area could change as a result of further study.</p>
<p>Transportation solutions in the corridor should consider the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Combined land use and transportation alternatives within the ‘Barbur envelope’ area, and resulting transportation and livability benefits and impacts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regional and local transit services and facilities, and the appropriate transit vehicle type to serve the Barbur corridor within the RTP planning horizon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possible new locations or relocations for I-5 on-ramps and off-ramps and street connections across the freeway right-of-way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities for new or improved local street connections to Barbur, including locations for possible signalized intersections and reconfiguration of angled intersections for safe, multimodal access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilities to improve bicycle and pedestrian safety along Barbur and access to transit services and local destinations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traffic management and intelligent transportation system improvements along the corridor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential mainline freeway improvements, including possible southbound truck climbing lanes and traffic and truck noise mitigation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special attention to the Barbur/Capitol/Taylors Ferry intersection and local street connectivity improvements in the West Portland area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordination with previous planning studies and recommendations from the South Portland Circulation Study, Barbur Boulevard Streetscape Plan, and Barbur Boulevard Streamline Project</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**RTP Studies **</p>
<p><strong><em>Interstate 205 Ramp Study</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Evaluate and recommend improvements to I-205 ramps at SE Powell and SE Division to eliminate confusing intersections that direct drivers to frontage roads</em></p>
<p>Based on adopted policy, the City designed the freeway ramp and collector-distributor road system on either side of the I-205 freeway to operate so Powell Boulevard on the west side of I-205 and Division on the east side of I-205 provide a continuous route from Portland to Gresham. This design was intended to take automobile and truck traffic off the more transit-oriented Division Street west of I-205 and use Division east of I-205, in combination with the more auto-oriented Powell Boulevard west of I-205, for the bulk of trips between the two centers.</p>
<p>The current design of the ramp termini reflects this policy intent. There has been recent interest, however, in revisiting the turn restrictions and physical restrictions imposed by the policy and design. ODOT and the City have agreed to analyze the type of improvements that might be necessary to remove the turn restrictions at SE 92^nd^ and Powell Boulevard and allow for more balanced turn movements throughout the interchange area.</p>
<p><strong><em>West Portland/I-5 Access and Crossings Study</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Identify possible new connections over I-5 to serve motor vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycle travel</em></p>
<p>Because of the barrier effect of I-5 and SW Barbur, the existing street pattern in the vicinity of the West Portland town center/Barbur transit center is incomplete, particularly in the north-south direction. This ‘wall’ limits connections between cultural, institutional, recreational, and commercial facilities such as Woods Memorial Park, Multnomah Village, the Multnomah Center, Gabriel Park, Jackson Middle School, Capitol Hill Library, Holly Farm Park, PCC-Sylvania, and Markham Elementary School. Topography presents a challenge to making additional connections in the vicinity of the transit center.</p>
<p><em>I-5 Crossing</em></p>
<p>The existing pedestrian/bicycle connection across I-5 ramps down from the transit center, crosses I-5 on a pedestrian bridge, then ramps down to SW Willard at 40^th^. The West Portland Town Center Study (December 1997) recommended enhancing the existing pedestrian bridge crossing by reconfiguring the park-and-ride lot, providing a new local street crossing in the vicinity of the transit center, and potentially capping a portion of I-5. In addition, sidewalk improvements are needed on local streets south of I5 to improve connections to the existing pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p><em>Local Street Connectivity</em></p>
<p>Southwest Barbur and I-5 create barriers at the north and south ends of the West Portland town center. Only Capitol Highway and the pedestrian bridge at the transit center cross I-5 in the vicinity of the town center, resulting in a local street network with missing links. Potential locations for local street crossings of I-5 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replacing the existing pedestrian/bicycle bridge over I-5 with a pedestrian-oriented, local street connection on the 39^th^/40^th^ alignment, connecting to 40^th^ at Wilbard Street and to SW 35^th^</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constructing a new local street that extends SW 48^th^ Avenue south on a new bridge structure to SW Huber Street and then connects to an extension of SW Alfred Street</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>● Constructing a bicycle/pedestrian bridge between the Ash Creek and Crestwood neighborhood and the West Portland Park neighborhood in the vicinity of the Dickinson Street corridor, south of Markham School</p>
<p><em>Land Use</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Relocating ramps in this area will create developable land and new land use potential.</li>
</ul>
<p>This study may be incorporated into the Barbur/I-5 refinement plan (described earlier in this chapter), which identifies many of the issues described here.</p>
<p><strong><em>Barbur Boulevard Crossings</em></strong></p>
<p>Existing commercial areas along the west side of Barbur and south of I-5 are relatively inaccessible by pedestrians. Barbur presents a barrier to pedestrian access because of wide paved areas, limited crossing opportunities, and relatively high traffic volumes and speeds. Safer and more convenient pedestrian circulation is needed to support commercial uses, access transit service, and support a future town center.</p>
<p>Additional study is needed to determine the need and feasibility of new connections, within the context of the additional land use and transportation analysis being conducted as part of the Barbur and I-5 corridor refinement plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Central City Pedestrian Enhancements Study</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Identify needed pedestrian improvements to address locations lacking pedestrian crossings, difficult bridge crossings, and access over freeways in the Central City</em></p>
<p>The Central City Transportation Management Plan’s (CCTMP) pedestrian policies and text note that the degree of pedestrian access is increased when the pedestrian network is “comprehensive in coverage, easily accessible, and without significant barriers and obstacles that would prevent its use.” The pedestrian enhancements study should:</p>
<p>● Identify gaps and deficiencies in the pedestrian network</p>
<p>● Examine ‘no pedestrian crossing’ locations and identify appropriate measures to improve access</p>
<p>● Examine the need for underpasses and the potential for alternative pedestrian crossing opportunities</p>
<p>● Identify pedestrian access improvements to and across Willamette River bridges</p>
<p>● Identify pedestrian access improvements across I-5, I-84, and I-405</p>
<p>● Identify connections to and from surrounding neighborhoods</p>
<p>● Identify locations where pedestrian crossings need improvements and/or signal modifications</p>
<p>● Identify reconfigurations of ramp intersections to provide continuous sidewalks on both sides of SE Grand and SE Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>With the pending completion of the Central City Multimodal Safety project, many pedestrian access improvements in the Central City will be identified.</p>
<p><strong>RTP Preferred System Studies</strong></p>
<p>The RTP project list includes the following studies only in the 2020 Preferred System. There is no timeframe associated with these studies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Third Track Connector Study</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Study additional rail capacity to address growth in high-speed rail and commuter rail from North Portland to Vancouver, Washington.</em></p>
<p>The 1999 Commuter Rail Feasibility Study evaluated the feasibility of regional commuter rail service operating on the existing freight rail lines. ODOT and the Washington Department of Transportation will jointly conduct a new Rail Capacity Analysis as part of the ongoing I-5 Transportation and Trade partnership. This study will examine possible commuter rail service between Portland and Vancouver/Woodland, and Portland and Camas/Washougal. It will consider the feasibility of commuter rail service on entirely new, separate, passenger-only rail lines for intercity passenger trains (including high-speed rail) and commuter rail trains. Potential ridership and infrastructure costs will also be examined. The study will likely find that a third rail line would be inadequate and two parallel passenger rail lines would be more feasible.</p>
<p><strong>PORTLAND PLANS AND STUDIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Refinement Plans</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Central City Transportation Management Plan (CCTMP) Update</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Update the CCTMP, including subarea access and circulation studies as needed</em></p>
<p>City staff must review and update the CCTMP’s policies, objectives, district strategies, and street classifications every five years. The review is limited to City Council directives, street reclassifications, new programs, policy amendments, land use changes, and legal issues, and must include a citizen involvement component. The CCTMP street classifications were updated as part of the TSP process to make them consistent with RTP classifications.</p>
<p><strong><em>MAX Light Rail Corridor Master Street Plan</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Complete the master street plan for areas between NE Glisan and SE Stark, east of the Gateway regional center</em></p>
<p>The RTP requires local jurisdictions to develop “conceptual new street plan maps” for “contiguous areas of vacant and redevelopable parcels of five or more acres planned or zoned for residential or mixed-use development.” The maps are intended to provide guidance to property owners and developers, as well as more certainty to nearby residents. The street plans should identify street connections to adjacent areas in a manner that promotes a convenient and well-connected street system. The street plans should show extensions to existing streets, new street connections to provide adequate connectivity, and a reliance on through-streets rather than closed street designs.</p>
<p>Because the MAX light rail corridor has unique connectivity needs, it was not included in the Far Southeast Street Master Plan study. A higher level of street connectivity is desirable in dense, mixed-use areas to access multiple destinations and disperse vehicle traffic throughout the area. High levels of pedestrian activity also warrant a more densely spaced street grid to facilitate movement and attain high mode split targets for alternatives to single-occupant vehicles.</p>
<p><strong><em>Citywide Master Street Plans</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Complete master street plans for the following districts: Southeast, Far Northeast, North, Northeast, and Northwest</em></p>
<p>The 2000 2014 RTP requires local jurisdictions to develop “conceptual new streets plan maps” for &quot;contiguous areas of vacant and redevelopable parcels of five or more acres planned or zoned for residential or mixed-use development. The maps are intended to provide guidance to property owners and developers as well as more certainty to nearby residents. The street plans must identify street connections to adjacent areas in a manner that promotes a convenient and well-connected street system. The street plans must show extensions to existing streets, new street connections to provide adequate connectivity, and reliance on through streets rather than closed street designs.</p>
<p>Areas of the City without adopted street plans must be analyzed to determine where adequate connectivity does not exist. Some areas, such as inner Southeast, have high levels of street connectivity that exceed regional standards. Other districts, such as Northwest, exhibit high street connectivity near the Central City, but poor connectivity in outlying areas where topography and industrial zoning may preclude connectivity. At a district level, the Far Northeast exhibits the lowest levels of connectivity for areas not covered by an adopted street plan.</p>

<p><strong>Studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>ODOT District Highways Evaluation</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Assess the long-term design and functional needs of state highways inside the City.</em></p>
<p>The City and ODOT are both interested in transitioning district highways within the City limits to Portland’s jurisdiction and management. These may include Sandy Boulevard, NE/SE 82^nd^ Avenue, N/NE Lombard, NE/SE Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard, and NE/SE Grand Avenue. Many of these highways have changed roles over time, as parallel state routes and limited-access highways were constructed. These district highways formerly served as through-routes, but now provide more local circulation and commercial access functions.</p>
<p>The City’s interest in assuming jurisdiction is based on land use (implementing 2040 main street development); development review (giving one agency permit authority for buildings, driveways, etc.); street design (incorporating multimodal features, more calmed traffic), and operations (implementing signalization, parking control, etc.).</p>
<p>The City must evaluate the significant cost implications of assuming jurisdiction for these district highways. Many of the highways need reconstruction or are not built to the level of urban standards the City desires. Jurisdiction also includes a long-term responsibility for maintenance and operations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Portland Central City Loop (RTP Mobility Corridor#4</em>)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Evaluate the current and future operations, design, and proposed improvements of the I-5/I-405 freeway loop in the Central City, and consider alternative design concepts.</em></p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to develop alternative design concepts for the inner freeway loop, addressing issues such as regional mobility; freight movements; access needs of Central City districts; minimization of physical barriers and impacts on the river; potential local street network improvements; and the role of alternative modes. The analysis should also evaluate changes to the transit system and the possible implications for land use in the district.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have evaluated the service capabilities of various existing segments of the inner freeway loop (such as the Greeley-Banfield segment and the Eastbank segment) and have recommended potential improvements. The freeway loop has not been evaluated as a whole system, however. Several recent planning activities indicate the need to evaluate the function and design of the entire inner freeway loop, given emerging land use and transportation objectives. These planning activities include the I-5 Transportation and Trade Partnership, the South Portland Circulation Study, the Rose Quarter Urban Design Plan and Development Strategy, the Lloyd District Development Strategy, and the Central Eastside Development Opportunity Strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Brooklyn Neighborhood River Access</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> <em>Study pedestrian and bike access from the Brooklyn neighborhood to the Willamette River.</em></p>
<p>The 1991 Brooklyn Neighborhood Plan identifies improved access to the riverfront as a longstanding neighborhood priority. Objective 6A1 of the plan states: “Re-establish Brooklyn’s access and historic link to the Willamette River.”</p>
<p>McLoughlin Boulevard creates a barrier that separates the neighborhood from the river. Existing access from the neighborhood to the river is via the lower-level ramps at the Ross Island Bridge, where steep terrain limits easy access, or via Holgate Boulevard, where pedestrians can cross at a stoplight, but can reach the river only by descending a bramble-covered bank. Haig Park is undeveloped parkland between the river and McLoughlin Boulevard, south of the SE Franklin Street alignment and north of the SE Haig Street alignment.</p>
<p>The neighborhood concept plan identifies a pedestrian overpass bridging McLoughlin as a way to provide river access. A recent study investigated alternative crossing locations of McLoughlin Boulevard and access routes to the Springwater Trail, and provided rough cost estimates. That study may be detailed enough to identify a preferred alternative for an improvement project. The next step would be to determinate if the project responds to a transportation need rather than a recreational need to qualify it for inclusion in the TSP. Because the preferred alternative may impact private property and existing business operations, a City Council hearing on the report’s acceptance is also recommended.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interjurisdictional Arterial Improvements Coordination</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose:</strong> Develop a coordinated street improvement plan for arterial streets that transcend jurisdictional boundaries.</em></p>
<p>This study would look at streets that cross jurisdictional lines, to identify changes in traffic volumes and traffic origins/destinations and to monitor how the streets’ classifications conform with their function and levels of regional traffic. Significant traffic growth is expected on streets that connect to other jurisdictions with planned population and/or employment growth. Evaluate pedestrian and bicycle access, mobility and improvements, especially where meeting jurisdictional boundaries.</p>
<p>Metro designates collector-level streets as part of the regional street system when a network of higher-classified streets is not present or lacks adequate capacity to carry regional traffic. Designated in the RTP as ‘collectors of regional significance’, these streets connect the regional arterial system and the local collector system and distribute neighborhood traffic to arterials. They have three purposes: 1) ensure adequate access to the primary and secondary land use components of the 2040 Growth Concept, 2) allow dispersion of arterial traffic over a number of lesser facilities where an adequate local network exists, and 3) define appropriate collector-level movement between jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The RTP designates some district and neighborhood collectors in Portland as collectors of regional significance. Examples of Portland streets that have this designation and extend beyond Portland boundaries are SW Taylors Ferry, SW Terwilliger, SE 52^nd^, SE 112^th^, SE Johnson Creek, and NW Cornell.</p>
<p><strong><em>NE Glisan Street Transportation and Streetscape Study</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Purpose</strong>: Identify transportation and streetscape improvements that address commercial, pedestrian, bicycle, safety and neighborhood livability needs.</em></p>
<p>Northeast Glisan been NE 67^th^ and 82^nd^ Avenues has been designated a main street in the Region 2040 Growth Concept. The TSP designated this segment of Glisan as a Community Main Street for street design purposes. The TSP contains one project, bike lanes, for NE Glisan.</p>
<p>Currently, this segment of Glisan stretches between two light rail stations at 60^th^ and 82^nd^. The land use and zoning pattern is storefront commercial, consistent with its main street designation. NE Glisan has the potential to be a thriving commercial district with multimodal connections. Barriers that prevent Glisan from realizing its potential include heavy automobile use as an alternative to I-84 during peak travel times; difficult pedestrian crossings and inadequate sidewalks and large curb cuts, missing bike lanes, intermittent on-street parking, and a lack of street trees.</p>
<p>Glisan St was given a road diet between 62nd and 81st avenues, improving pedestrian crossing conditions. However, nothing has yet been done on this stretch specifically for bicycle safety.</p>

North south access points across the railroad are currently limited to few locations, are substandard for all modes, and include several deficient bridges. If Union Pacific double-tracks the Kenton railroad line, north south access could be significantly impacted for freight, transit, bicyclists, pedestrians, and drivers. Traffic analysis has also indicated significant and growing freight delay along Columbia Blvd, improved pedestrian and bicycle access to transit is also needed to support a proposed bus line along Columbia Blvd. The study would identify key connectivity needs for all modes, and develop a proposal to work with Union Pacific, other public sector agencies, and private sector organizations to ensure ongoing connectivity needs are met.</h4>

<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p>The Transportation System Plan uses clear, everyday language as much as possible. Words and terms in the Glossary have the specific meaning stated below when used in the Comprehensive Plan and TSP, unless the context clearly indicates another meaning. Words not included in this Glossary are defined by their dictionary meaning, or in some cases, by their meaning in state or federal law.</p>
<p>2040 Growth Concept</p>
<p>A concept for the long-term growth management of our region, developed by Metro. It describes</p>
<p>the preferred form of regional growth, including where growth should be clustered, what the</p>
<p>appropriate densities are for various land use design types, and which areas should be protected as open space. The 2040 Growth Concept was adopted as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. (Source: 2000 RTP)</p>
<p>Access</p>
<p>The ability to approach or make use of transportation facilities, parks and open space, public</p>
<p>infrastructure, or businesses and services that are open to the public. Good access means within close proximity (up to ó mile) that is free from physical barriers for those with limited mobility.</p>
<p>Access Management</p>
<p>Measures regulating access to streets, roads, and highways from public roads and private</p>
<p>driveways. Measures may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the siting of</p>
<p>interchanges, restrictions on the type and amount of access to roadways, and use of physical</p>
<p>controls (such as signals and channelization, including raised medians) to reduce impacts of</p>
<p>approach road traffic on the main facility.</p>
<p>Accessibility</p>
<p>The ability to move easily from one mode of transportation to another mode or to a destination.</p>
<p>Accessibility increases when the number and quality of travel choices increases. Accessibility is</p>
<p>affected by the mix of land uses and the travel alternatives available.</p>
<p>Accessway</p>
<p>A type of right-of-way, either public or private, that is primarily to provide pedestrian and</p>
<p>bicycle linkages consistent with connectivity needs, but may be used for vehicle access to</p>
<p>parking or for emergency vehicles. Accessways are typically short in length and are used where</p>
<p>full street connections are not needed and/or are not physically feasible.</p>
<p>Active Transportation</p>
<p>Transportation that involves physical activity, including walking, biking and using transit.</p>
<p>Activity Center</p>
<p>A cluster of uses that collectively generates many trips (e.g., school and park, neighborhood</p>
<p>commercial district). An activity center can be a single use that generates many trips (e.g.,</p>
<p>stadium, large commercial outlet, large institution).</p>
<p>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990</p>
<p>Civil rights legislation enacted by Congress that mandates the development of a plan to address</p>
<p>discrimination and equal opportunity for disabled persons in employment, transportation,</p>
<p>public accommodation, public services, and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Area Permit Parking Program</p>
<p>A Portland Bureau of Transportation program to ensure that on-street parking associated with</p>
<p>commercial, industrial, institutional development or large events will not spill over into adjacent</p>
<p>residential neighborhoods. The program allows residents and firms a limited supply of permits</p>
<p>for on-street parking and restricts on-street parking for other potential users.</p>
<p>Arterial</p>
<p>Any street that is not a Local Service Traffic Street according to the traffic classification maps in</p>
<p>the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Arterials include Regional Trafficways,</p>
<p>Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, Neighborhood Collectors, and Traffic Access</p>
<p>Streets.</p>
<p><em>Also:</em> A class of street. Arterial streets interconnect and support the throughway system.</p>
<p>Arterials are intended to provide general mobility for travel within the region. Correctly sized</p>
<p>arterials at appropriate intervals allow through trips to remain on the arterial system thereby</p>
<p>discouraging use of local streets for cut-through travel. Arterial streets link major commercial,</p>
<p>residential, industrial and institutional areas. Major arterials serve longer distance through trips</p>
<p>and serve more of a regional traffic function. Minor arterials serve shorter, more localized travel</p>
<p>within a community. As a result, major arterials usually carry more traffic than minor arterials.</p>
<p>Arterial streets are usually spaced about one mile apart and are designed to accommodate</p>
<p>bicycle, pedestrian, truck and transit travel.</p>
<p>Attractor</p>
<p>A use that, by its nature, draws large numbers of people to it for special events or regular</p>
<p>activities. Regional attractors include uses such as sports arenas and convention centers.</p>
<p>Auto-Oriented Development</p>
<p>Development that is either: 1) auto-related (such as gas stations and auto repair shops) or 2)</p>
<p>auto-accommodating (by its design attracts primarily customers and employees arriving by</p>
<p>automobile, such as drive-in restaurants).</p>
<p>Benchmark</p>
<p>A specific target or goal to be achieved in a specific timeframe. Benchmarks are used to</p>
<p>determine the attainment of performance indicators and performance measures (defined</p>
<p>below).</p>
<p>Bicycle</p>
<p>A vehicle having two tandem wheels, a minimum of 14 inches in diameter, propelled by</p>
<p>human power, upon which a person or persons may ride. A three-wheeled adult tricycle</p>
<p>is considered a bicycle. In Oregon, a bicycle is legally defined as a vehicle. Bicyclists have</p>
<p>the same right to the roadways and must obey the same traffic laws as the operators of</p>
<p>other vehicles.</p>
<p>Bicycle Boulevard</p>
<p>See Neighborhood Greenway.</p>
<p>Bicyclist</p>
<p>Person riding a bicycle.</p>
<p>Bike Share</p>
<p>Bike Share is an innovative transportation program that provides users access to</p>
<p>bicycles on a short-term basis for one-way travel within a designated service area.</p>
<p>Carpool</p>
<p>A motor vehicle carrying two or three (depending on the context) or more people, usually</p>
<p>commuting on a regular or semi-regular basis.</p>
<p>Car Sharing</p>
<p>An organization consisting of a group of individuals who share a fleet of cars. The purchase or</p>
<p>lease of vehicles, fuel costs, maintenance and repair costs is borne by the organization.</p>
<p>Centers</p>
<p>Places with concentrations of commercial and community services, housing, gathering places,</p>
<p>and transit connections. Centers provide services to surrounding neighborhoods and are</p>
<p>intended to be enhanced as places because they are a focus of housing and job growth. There are four types of centers with varying functions, levels of activity, and scales and intensities of</p>
<p>development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central City: Corresponds to the Central City plan district, which serves as the region’s</li>
</ul>
<p>premier center, anchoring an interconnected system of centers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gateway Regional Center: Corresponds to the Gateway plan district, East Portland’s largest center, which is intended to be enhanced as an employment and community service hub within the area and region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Town Centers: Large centers that serve a broad area of the city and have an important role in accommodating growth. They provide a full range of commercial and community services, high-density housing, mid-rise commercial and mid-rise mixed-use buildings (typically up to five to seven stories in height), are served by high-capacity transit connections, and have a substantial employment component. Town Centers provide housing opportunities for enough population to support a full-service business district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Centers: Centers that primarily serve adjacent neighborhoods and provide</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>opportunities for additional housing and low- to mid-rise commercial and mixed-use</p>
<p>buildings (typically up to three to five stories in height). They provide a range of local</p>
<p>commercial and community services and transit connections. Neighborhood Centers</p>
<p>provide housing opportunities for about half the population needed to support a</p>
<p>neighborhood business district.</p>
<p>City Greenway</p>
<p>A system of distinctive pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly green streets and trails, enhanced by</p>
<p>lush tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that support active living by expanding</p>
<p>transportation and recreational opportunities and making it easier and more attractive to reach</p>
<p>destinations across the city. City Greenways are a network that includes the following types of</p>
<p>infrastructure:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enhanced greenway corridors are distinctive green streets with extensive tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that provide connections between major centers, schools, parks, natural areas, and the rivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trails are often located along rivers or through natural areas, providing pedestrian and bicycle connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heritage parkways are iconic streets or segments of streets with elements such as linear parkways, scenic views, and distinctive landscaping or street design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood greenways are an extensive network of streets with low volumes of motor vehicle traffic that are prioritized for bicycles and enhanced for pedestrians, working in conjunction with the rest of the City Greenways system to extend the system into all neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Collector of Regional Significance</p>
<p>As designated in the 2000 Regional Transportation Plan, a route that connects the regional</p>
<p>arterial system and the local system by collecting and distributing neighborhood traffic to</p>
<p>arterial streets. Collectors of regional significance have three purposes: 1) They ensure adequate access to the primary and secondary land use components of the 2040 Growth Concept; 2) They allow dispersion of arterial traffic over a number of lesser facilities where an adequate local network exists; 3) They help define appropriate collector level movement between jurisdictions. (Source: 2000 RTP)</p>
<p>Collector street</p>
<p>A class of street. Collector streets provide both access and circulation between residential,</p>
<p>commercial, industrial and agricultural community areas and the arterial system. As such,</p>
<p>collectors tend to carry fewer motor vehicles than arterial streets, with reduced travel speeds.</p>
<p>Collector streets are usually spaced at half-mile intervals, midway between arterial streets.</p>
<p>Collectors may serve as bike, pedestrian and freight access routes, providing local connections to the arterial street network and transit system. While the focus for collectors has been on motor vehicle traffic, they are developed as multi-modal facilities that accommodate bicycles,</p>
<p>pedestrians and transit.</p>
<p>Complete Streets</p>
<p>Complete streets provide accessibility to all users of the right-of-way regardless of age, ability, or mode of transportation. They are designed and operated to make better places and to enhance safe access for all modes, including people walking and bicycling, those using a mobility device, motorists, and transit users.</p>
<p>Community Uses</p>
<p>Community uses in the right of way include but are not limited to temporary uses such</p>
<p>as public gathering spaces, events, food production or temporary festivals, etc.</p>
<p>Congestion</p>
<p>A condition characterized by unstable traffic flows that prevents reliable movement on a</p>
<p>transportation facility.</p>
<p>Connected Vehicle</p>
<p>a vehicle that communicates with the Internet, other vehicles, wayside systems and/or passengers.</p>
<p>Corridor</p>
<p>1. Corridors (2040 design type) – A type of land use that is typically located along regional transit routes and arterial streets, providing a place for somewhat higher densities than is found in 2040 centers. These land uses should feature a high-quality pedestrian environment and</p>
<p>convenient access to transit. Typical new developments would include rowhouses, duplexes and one to three-story office and retail buildings, and average about 25 persons per acre. While some corridors may be continuous, narrow bands of higher-intensity development along arterial</p>
<p>streets, others may be more nodal, that is a series of smaller centers at major intersections or</p>
<p>other locations along the arterial that have high quality pedestrian environments, good</p>
<p>connection to adjacent neighborhoods and transit service.</p>
<p>2. Corridor as defined in the Comprehensive Plan is an area that may be a single major street, or a broad mobility corridor that provides connections for a range of transportation modes (transit, pedestrians, cyclists, freight, motor vehicles, and so forth), not necessarily on the same street. There are three types of corridor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Civic Corridor: These are a prioritized subset of the city’s most prominent transit and transportation streets. They connect centers, provide regional connections, and include segments where commercial development and housing are focused. Civic Corridors are intended to continue their important transportation functions while providing livable environments for people, and evolving into distinctive places that are models of ecological design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Corridor: Main streets that connect neighborhoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They support neighborhood business districts and provide housing opportunities close to local services, amenities, and transit lines. They are streets that include a mix of commercial and higher-density housing development. They have less intense development and transportation function than Civic Corridors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freight Corridor: Primary routes into and through the city that support Portland as an important West Coast hub and a gateway for international and domestic trade. These facilities are integral to the growth of traded sector businesses such as manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution industries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Curb Zone</p>
<p>The area of public right-of-way adjacent to the curb that can be used for a wide variety of</p>
<p>mobility and access functions, including but not limited to vehicle lanes, bike lanes, curb</p>
<p>extensions, transit platforms, street trees, loading zones, on-street parking, bike corrals, and</p>
<p>street seats.</p>
<p>Early Bird Parking</p>
<p>Parking that is provided to encourage its use primarily by commuters. Typically, the pricing</p>
<p>strategy is to offer a lower all-day rate if the parker arrives before a certain time in the morning.</p>
<p>Electric Vehicle</p>
<p>An electric vehicle (EV), also referred to as an electric drive vehicle, is a vehicle which uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Depending on the type of vehicle, motion may be provided by wheels or propellers driven by rotary motors, or in the case of tracked vehicles, by linear motors.</p>
<p>Emergency Response Vehicles</p>
<p>Vehicles employed in responding to emergencies. Examples of emergency response vehicles</p>
<p>include fire apparatus, ambulances, and police cars.</p>
<p>Employer Commute Options (ECO)</p>

<p>day.</p>
<p>Functional Plan</p>
<p>A limited-purpose, multijurisdictional plan for an area or activity having significant districtwide</p>
<p>impact on the orderly and responsible development of the metropolitan area. A Functional Plan</p>
<p>serves as a guideline for local comprehensive plans consistent, with ORS 268.390.</p>

<p>health and safety, open space, and other complementary ecosystem services. Examples include</p>
<p>trees, ecoroofs, green street facilities, wetlands, and natural waterways.</p>
<p>Green Street</p>
<p>A green street is a street with a landscaped street-side planter or bioswale that captures</p>
<p>stormwater runoff from the street and allows it to soak into the ground as soil and vegetation</p>
<p>filter out pollutants. A green street is not the same as a City Greenway, though a City Greenway</p>
<p>may include green street elements.</p>
<p>High-capacity Transit</p>
<p>High-capacity transit is public transit that bypasses congestion by making full or partial use of</p>
<p>exclusive right of way, a non-exclusive right of way, using transit priority or a</p>
<p>combination of both. Vehicles make fewer stops, travel at higher speeds, have more frequent</p>
<p>service, and carry more people than local service transit such as typical bus lines. High-capacity</p>
<p>transit can be provided by a variety of vehicle types including light rail, commuter rail, streetcar,</p>
<p>and bus.</p>
<p>High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)</p>
<p>Any vehicle carrying two or more persons, including the driver. An HOV could be a transit bus,</p>
<p>vanpool, carpool, or any other vehicle that meets the minimum occupancy requirements.</p>
<p>Consistent with federal regulations, motorcycles (with or without passengers) are considered</p>
<p>HOVs.</p>
<p>Historically marginalized communities</p>

<p>Transportation Plan and the planning of regional transportation projects, including light rail.</p>
<p>Mixed-Use Areas</p>
<p>Compact areas of development that include a mix of uses, either within buildings or among</p>
<p>buildings, and include residential development as one of the potential components.</p>
<p>Mobility Zone</p>
<p>The area of the right-of-way used primarily for people and/or goods movement.</p>
<p>Multimodal Mixed-Use Area (MMA)</p>
<p>The Multimodal Mixed-Use Area (MMA) is an ODOT designation applied by local governments</p>
<p>to downtowns, town centers, main streets or other areas inside Urban Growth Boundaries where</p>
<p>the local government determines there is: high quality connectivity to and within the area by</p>
<p>modes of transportation other than the automobile; a denser level of development of a variety of</p>
<p>commercial and residential uses than the surrounding areas; a desire to encourage these</p>
<p>characteristics through development standards and an understanding that increased automobile</p>
<p>congestion within and around the MMA is accepted as a potential trade-off.</p>
<p>Mobility</p>
<p>The ability to move people and goods from place to place, or the potential for movement.</p>
<p>Mobility improves when the transportation network is refined or expanded to improve capacity</p>

<p>Mode Split</p>
<p>The percentage of trips taken by each of the possible modes of travel (motor vehicle, transit,</p>
<p>bicycle, walk). Mode split does not refer to the number of trips. For example, the number of trips</p>
<p>by a particular mode may increase, but the percentage of trips by that mode may stay the same</p>
<p>or be reduced if there is also growth in the overall number of trips for other modes.</p>
<p>Motor Vehicle Level-of-Service (LOS)</p>
<p>A qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream. A level-of-service</p>
<p>definition generally describes these conditions in terms of such factors as speed and</p>
<p>travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort, convenience, and safety. LOS</p>
<p>ratings of ‘A’ through ‘F’ describe the traffic flow characteristics on streets and highways and at</p>
<p>intersections, as shown on the following table:</p>
<p><img src="/img/media/image2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Multimodal</p>
<p>Having a variety of modes available for any given trip, such as being able to walk, ride a bicycle,</p>

<p>populations unable to use regular transit service. Other examples include demand-responsive</p>
<p>(e.g., dial-a-ride) and contracted fixed-route service.</p>
<p>Park-and-Ride Facility</p>
<p>A parking lot or structure in association with a light rail station, transit stop, or transit transfer</p>
<p>point. Generally, park-and-rides should provide access to regional route service for areas not</p>
<p>directly served by transit. Bicycle and pedestrian access, as well as parking and storage for</p>
<p>bicycles, should be considered in locating new park-and-ride facilities.</p>
<p>Pattern Areas</p>
<p>Five primary geographies in Portland that have differing physical characteristics, needs, and</p>
<p>assets. Each of these areas has unique topographies and natural features, patterns and types of development, street and other infrastructure characteristics, and histories that have shaped</p>
<p>their urban form. The five primary Pattern Areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Central City: This area corresponds to the Central City plan district and is also a major center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inner Neighborhoods: This area includes inner portions of the city that originally developed during the streetcar era, prior to World War II. It includes a large part of the city east of the Willamette River, extending roughly to 82nd Avenue, and also the inner westside “flats,” located between the river and the West Hills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Western Neighborhoods: This area includes the West Hills (Tualatin Mountains) and areas to the west.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eastern Neighborhoods: This area includes eastern portions of the city, mostly located east of 82nd Avenue and largely annexed to Portland in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>River: This area includes the land along the Willamette and Columbia Rivers and the Columbia Slough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Peak Period</p>
<p>The period of the day during which the maximum amount of travel occurs. Peak periods in</p>
<p>Portland metro area are generally defined as 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM.</p>
<p>Peak Period Pricing</p>
<p>A transportation management tool that applies market pricing principles to roadway use. Peak-period pricing imposes user surcharges or tolls on congested facilities during peak traffic periods and may allow a reduced price for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) use.</p>
<p>Pedestrian</p>
<p>A person on foot, in a wheelchair, or in another health-related mobility device.</p>
<p>Performance Indicator</p>
<p>A term that describes a characteristic of the transportation system in order to measure progress</p>
<p>towards a specific goal.</p>
<p>Performance Measure</p>
<p>A method used to assign a value to a performance indicator. Performance indicators measure</p>
<p>change over time, and the performance measure is a specific activity or physical change that can be measured.</p>
<p>Performance Targets and Standards</p>
<p>A metric to demonstrate progress toward.</p>
<p>Policies</p>
<p>The choices made to carry out goals in the foreseeable futures. Policies should be specific</p>
<p>enough to help determine whether or not a proposed project, program, or course of action will</p>
<p>advance community values expressed in goals.</p>
<p>Port of Portland</p>
<p>A public agency that owns and maintains five marine terminals, four airports, and seven</p>
<p>business parks in the three-county area. The Port is governed by a nine-member commission</p>
<p>appointed by the governor.</p>
<p>Protected Bike Lane</p>
<p>Bicycle lanes that are physically separated from motor vehicle and pedestrian travel. A protected bike lane is an exclusive bicycle facility that combines the user experience of a separated path with the on-street infrastructure of a conventional bike lane. A protected bike lane is physically separated from motor traffic and distinct from the sidewalk, using vertical elements such as physical curbs or flexible delineators.</p>
<p>Public Facility</p>
<p>Any facility, including buildings, property, and capital assets, that is owned, leased, or otherwise</p>
<p>operated, or funded by a governmental body or public entity. Examples of public facilities</p>
<p>include sewage treatment and collection facilities, stormwater and flood management facilities,</p>
<p>water supply and distribution facilities, streets, and other transportation assets, parks, and</p>
<p>public buildings. See also Infrastructure.</p>

<p>Speed cushion</p>
<p>Speed cushions are either speed humps or speed tables that include wheel cutouts to allow large vehicles to pass unaffected, while reducing passenger car speeds. They can be offset to allow unimpeded passage by emergency vehicles and are typically used on key emergency response routes. Speed cushions extend across one direction of travel from the centerline, with longitudinal gap provided to allow wide wheel base vehicles to avoid going over the hump.</p>
<p>Traffic Calming</p>
<p>Roadway design strategies to reduce vehicle speeds and volumes, prevent inappropriate through traffic and reduce motor vehicle travel speeds while also aimed at improving traffic safety and neighborhood livability. Traffic calming strategies provide speed bumps, curb extensions, planted median strips or round and narrowed travel lanes.</p>

<p>service to support the neighborhood commercial uses and have a lower demand for parking than auto-oriented land uses.</p>
<p>Transit station areas</p>
<p>Areas within a half-mile of light rail and other high-capacity transit stations. Some transit</p>
<p>station areas are located within centers or civic corridors and are subject to policies for those</p>
<p>types of places.</p>
<p>Transportation Demand Management (TDM)</p>
<p>Actions taken to change travel behavior in order to improve the performance of transportation</p>
<p>facilities, reduce the need for additional road capacity, and reduce impacts on residential</p>
<p>neighborhoods. Examples include encouraging the use of alternatives to single-occupant</p>
<p>vehicles (SOVs), ridesharing and vanpools, parking management, and trip-reduction</p>
<p>ordinances.</p>

<p>Transportation Planning Rule (TPR)</p>
<p>The implementing rule of Statewide Planning Goal 12 dealing with transportation, as adopted by</p>
<p>the State Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC). Among its provisions, the</p>
<p>TPR requires reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 15 percent in the next 30</p>
<p>years, reducing parking spaces per capita by 10 percent in the next 20 years, and improving</p>
<p>opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<p>Transportation System Management (TSM)</p>
<p>Strategies and techniques for increasing the efficiency, safety, or level-of-service of a</p>
<p>transportation facility without increasing its size. Examples include, but are not limited to,</p>

<p>TriMet</p>
<p>Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District, the transit agency for most of Clackamas,</p>
<p>Multnomah, and Washington Counties.</p>
<p>Trip</p>
<p>A journey made by any mode between an origin and a destination. Trips can be categorized as</p>
<p>follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regional trip – A trip that has neither trip origin nor destination within the Portland metro\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>area.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interregional trip – A trip that has one trip end within the Portland region and the other trip end outside the Portland region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interdistrict trip – A trip that starts in one Transportation District and ends in another\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transportation District.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intradistrict trip – A trip that starts and ends within the same Transportation District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-local trip --A trip that extends beyond the length of the functional purpose described in a street’s classification description.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trip End</p>
<p>The origin or destination point of a journey.</p>
<p>Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP)</p>
<p>A regional functional plan with requirements binding on cities and counties in the Metro region,</p>
<p>as mandated by Metro’s Regional Framework Plan. The plan addresses accommodation of</p>
<p>projected regional population and job growth, regional parking management, water quality</p>
<p>conservation, and limits on retail uses in employment and industrial areas.</p>
<p>Volume-to-capacity (v/c) Ratio</p>
<p>A measure of potential roadway capacity. A ratio expressing the relationship between the</p>
<p>existing or anticipated volume of traffic on a roadway and the designed capacity of the facility.</p>
<p>Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) per Capita</p>
<p>Miles driven in automobiles per person on average. The Transportation Planning Rule requires</p>
<p>a 10 percent reduction of VMT per capita within 20 years of adoption of a Transportation</p>
<p>System Plan, and an additional 5 percent reduction within 30 years of adoption of the TSP. The</p>
<p>VMT per capita reductions mean that individuals will, on average, travel less by automobile than</p>
<p>previously but, because the population will continue to grow, it does not mean an overall</p>
<p>reduction in the amount of miles driven.</p>
