                  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Portland is projected to add 140,000 new jobs and 260,000 new residents
over the next 20 years. As Portland and the region grow, however, there
is a continuing challenge to maintain the natural environment, economic
prosperity, and overall quality of life. If in 2035 the percentage of
people who drive alone to work remains near 60% as is was in 2015,
traffic, carbon emissions, and household spending on vehicles and fuel
will all worsen significantly. In order to accommodate this growth, our
transportation system must provide Portlanders safer and more convenient
ways to walk, bike, and take transit for more trips. The Transportation
System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide transportation policies and
investments in Portland. The 2035 Transportation System Plan guides
investments to maintain and improve the livability of Portland by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>saving lives and reducing injuries to all people using our
transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>limiting traffic congestion so transit and freight vehicles can move
more reliably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reducing carbon emissions and promoting healthy lifestyles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keeping more money in the local economy, as we spend less on
vehicles and fuel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creating great places</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The TSP meets state and regional planning requirements and addresses
local transportation needs. Transportation planning that promotes active
transportation modes is essential to preserving the City’s livability
and for the protection of the natural environment Constructing
significant amounts of new automobile capacity to accommodate growth is
not a desirable option because of the enormous costs and impacts. Adding
more streets and parking lots divides neighborhoods, uses valuable land,
encourages urban sprawl, and has negative environmental impacts.
Alternative approaches, supporting a safer, more affordable and more
complete multimodal transportation network must be used to ensure
integrated, comprehensive solutions. The first TSP was adopted by
Council in 2002 (Ordinance 177028).</p>
<p>The Transportation System Plan helps implement the City’s 2035
Comprehensive Plan in addition to the region’s 2040 Growth Concept by
supporting a transportation system that makes it more convenient for
people to walk, bicycle, use transit, and drive less to meet their daily
needs. The TSP also recognizes that the transportation system must help
grow and sustain the City’s economic health by accommodating the needs
of businesses and supporting Portland’s role in the international
economy.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h2>
<p>The transportation system is essential to the functioning of the city
and the well-being and prosperity of the community. It connects people
and businesses to goods and services, and links them to the region,
state, nation, and world. Although transportation is often measured in
terms of mobility, it also creates access to opportunity. The way we
build our city has an impact on our mobility and, by extension, our
access to opportunity. These goals and policies also reflect the role of
transportation planning in reducing carbon emissions and improving
public health. Finally, this chapter acknowledges the role that streets
can play in providing great civic and recreational spaces.</p>
<p>With its 1980 Comprehensive Plan, the City of Portland became a national
leader in the integration of land use and transportation. The 2035
Comprehensive Plan builds on that tradition and adds new innovations.
The goals and policies in this chapter increase the focus on complete
multimodal transportation systems. The historical emphasis on automobile
mobility increasingly creates a cost burden on households and the
community as a whole. For the city to successfully meet its
transportation system goals for the future, other more affordable
choices must be widely available and safe.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-transportation-system-plan">What is the Transportation System Plan?</h2>
<p>The Transportation System Plan (TSP) is the 20-year plan to guide
transportation investments in Portland. The TSP meets state and regional
planning requirements and addresses local transportation needs. It
includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Policies that guide the maintenance, development, and implementation
of Portland’s transportation system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of projects necessary to accommodate 20 years of growth in
population and employment, including a financial plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master street plans and modal plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategies and regulations for implementation, including street
classification maps.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Elements of the TSP — the policies, the projects included in the List of
Significant Projects, street classification maps, and street plan maps —
are adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan. The TSP itself is adopted
concurrently with the Comprehensive Plan but is published under a
separate cover. For ease of use and transparency, the citywide policies
from the TSP are also included in this chapter of the Comprehensive
Plan.</p>
<p>The TSP also provides more detail than the Comprehensive Plan by
including additional sub-policies and area-specific policies, and
additional supporting information about transportation system
conditions. The TSP contains the transportation element of the City’s
Public Facilities Plan. Figure 9-1 — Transportation System Plan:
Relationship to Other Policies and Plans illustrates the relationship
between the TSP and other policies and plans.</p>
<p>The 2035 TSP includes:</p>
<p>Goals and policies that guide the maintenance, development and
implementation of Portland’s transportation system</p>
<p>Objectives that further the implementation of the goals and policies</p>
<p>A list of projects and City wide programs along with a financial plan
that will accommodate 20 years of population and employment growth</p>
<p>Master street plans and modal plans</p>
<p>Strategies and regulations for implementation, including street
classifications</p>
<h2 id="elements-of-the-tsp">Elements of the TSP</h2>
<p>The goals and policies, street classification descriptions and maps, the
financial plan and the master street plan maps in the TSP are adopted as
part of the Comprehensive Plan, but published under a separate cover.</p>
<p>For ease of use and transparency, transportation related policies from
the 2035 Comprehensive Plan (2015) in Chapter 9 (Transportation),
Chapter 3 (Urban Design), Chapter 4 (Development) and Chapter 8 (Public
Facilities) are included in the Reference Section (Appendix A). The TSP
also includes additional sub-policies, geographic -specific policies,
and objectives.**</p>
<p>The TSP is both an implementation tool and a supporting document to the
Comprehensive Plan. It contains the transportation element of the City’s
Public Facilities Plan, and the List of Significant Projects and
Citywide Programs. The TSP also provides more detail than the
Comprehensive Plan by including additional supporting information about
transportation system conditions.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-system-plan-updates">Transportation System Plan Updates</h2>
<p>In order to keep the TSP current and up-to-date with recent
transportation planning and development activities, it is updated at
regular intervals. The first two updates were not intended to include
new policy initiatives. They were primarily technical in nature and
included corrections, updates to project descriptions, updates on
studies, and inclusion of new master street plans adopted as a part of
planning efforts.</p>
<p>The first update was completed and adopted by City Council on October
13, 2004 (effective date, November 12, 2004; Ordinance Nos. 178815 and
178826).</p>
<p>The second update was completed and adopted by City Council on April 5,
2007 (effective date, May 5, 2007; Ordinance No 180871). While primarily
technical in nature, this update also included new policy language to
implement the City’s Green Street Policy.</p>
<p>The Stage 2 update is a part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan update and
changes were made to implement the Comp Plan, as well as reflect adopted
plans and classification changes since the last update in 2007. The
Stage 3 of the update (2016) will incorporate regional information,
update geographic policies and objectives, additional street
classification changes, modal plans, other changes as identified, and
reformat the document.</p>
<h2 id="regulatory-framework">REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</h2>
<p>The TSP addresses and complies with a number of State and regional
goals, policies, and regulations, as summarized below.</p>

<h4 id="statewide-planning-goals">Statewide Planning Goals</h4>
<p>Oregon has 19 goals that provide a foundation for the State’s land use
planning program. The TSP must comply with all applicable State goals.
The two goals directly applicable to the TSP are Goal 11: Public
Facilities Plan and Goal 12: Transportation.</p>
<h4 id="transportation-planning-rule">Transportation Planning Rule</h4>
<p>The Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) implements statewide planning
Goal 12: Transportation. The TPR requires State, regional, and local
jurisdictions to develop Transportation System Plans (TSPs) that comply
with TPR provisions. These provisions include reducing vehicle miles
traveled (VMT) per capita by 10 percent over the next 20 years, reducing
parking spaces per capita, and improving opportunities for alternatives
to the automobile.</p>
<h4 id="oregon-transportation-plan">Oregon Transportation Plan</h4>
<p>The Oregon Transportation Plan (OTP) serves as the State’s TSP. Regional
and local TSPs must be consistent with the OTP.</p>
<h3 id="regional-metro">Regional Metro</h3>
<h4 id="regional-transportation-plan">Regional Transportation Plan</h4>
<p>First adopted by Metro in 1983, with latest update in 2014, the Regional
Transportation Plan (RTP) serves as the regional TSP. As such, the RTP:</p>
<p>Is consistent with the requirements of the State TPR and OTP</p>
<p>Implements the 2040 Growth Concept and Regional Framework Plan</p>
<p>Focuses on the regional transportation system</p>
<p>Includes multimodal functional classifications and street design
classifications</p>
<p>Includes a list of major system improvements</p>
<p>Includes a funding plan</p>
<h4 id="region-2040-growth-concept">Region 2040 Growth Concept</h4>
<p>Metro adopted the 2040 Growth Concept as part of the Regional Urban
Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. The 2040 Growth Concept
stated the preferred form of long-term regional growth and development,
including the urban growth boundary (UGB), density, and open space
protection. It also designates design types, such as central city,
regional center, town center, and main street.</p>
<h4 id="regional-transportation-functional-plan">Regional Transportation Functional Plan</h4>
<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (first adopted in 2010, last
updated in 2012; Ordinance No 10-1241B) implements the Goals and
Objectives in section 2.3 of the RTP and the policies of the RTP, and
replaces the regional parking policy of the Urban Growth Management
Functional Plan (See RTFP Title 4: Regional Parking Management.) It
provides policy basis and direction for local TSPs. The RTFP codifies
requirements that local plans must comply with to be consistent with the
Regional Transportation Plan. Therefore, its requirements are binding on
cities and counties.</p>
<h4 id="urban-growth-management-functional-plan">Urban Growth Management Functional Plan</h4>
<p>Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP) in
1996 and updated it 2014 to implement regional goals and objectives
adopted by the Metro Council as the Regional Growth Goals and Objectives
(RUGGO), including the 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework
Plan. The UGMFP addresses the accommodation of regional population and
job growth. Its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>
<h4 id="regional-framework-plan">Regional Framework Plan</h4>
<p>The Regional Framework Plan, adopted in 1997, identifies regional
policies to implement the 2040 Growth Concept, preserving access to
nature and building great communities for today and the future. The plan
was amended in 2005 and 2010, and again in 2014 as part of the adoption
of the Climate Smart Strategy.</p>
<h3 id="city-of-portland">City of Portland</h3>
<h4 id="comprehensive-plan">Comprehensive Plan</h4>
<p>Portland’s 2035 Comprehensive Plan guides land use development and
public facility investment decisions between now and 2035. This guidance
is intended to help make Portland more prosperous, healthy, equitable
and resilient.</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Plan includes five elements that work together to
accomplish this goal:</p>
<p>Vision and Guiding Principles</p>
<p>Goals and Policies</p>
<p>Comprehensive Plan Map</p>
<p>List of Significant Projects</p>
<p>Transportation policies, classifications and master street plans</p>
<p>The goals and policies in the TSP convey the City’s intent to:</p>
<p>Create a coordinated, efficient, and more affordable multimodal
transportation system.</p>
<p>Make cost-effective investments and system-management decisions that
encourage people to choose healthy, active, and low-carbon
transportation modes and systems, and enhance the economic
competitiveness of the region.</p>
<p>Reduce service disparities and achieve equitable access to all types of
facilities and transportation modes.</p>
<p>Ensure safety for users of all transportation modes, with attention to
the most vulnerable users, including people with disabilities, those
using mobility devices, the young, and the elderly.</p>
<p>Guide the location and design of new street, pedestrian, bicycle, and
trail infrastructure.</p>
<p>Direct how and when transportation infrastructure is managed and
maintained.</p>
<p>Provide policy guidance for developing and implementing the
Transportation System Plan.</p>
<p>Within the Comprehensive Plan and TSP, there are nine Transportation
goals:</p>

<p>Working with our partners at Metro, Bureau of Planning and
Sustainability, and the Oregon Department of Transportation, with
direction from the Portland Plan (2012), the Climate Action Plan (2010),
Health Equity &amp; the Transportation System Plan Report (2012), and from
the Comprehensive Plan Update, Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT)
staff developed an outcomes based approach to the TSP.</p>
<p>These seven outcomes directed policy choices as well as informed the
development of criteria for selecting and prioritizing TSP Projects and
Programs. The Transportation System Improvements Chapter contains
details on the citywide project and programs process and evaluation.</p>
<p>These seven outcomes are:</p>
<p>Improve access to daily needs, such as jobs, schools, grocery stores,
and health care</p>
<p>Reduce/eliminate transportation fatalities and injuries</p>
<p>Improve health by increasing walking and bicycling</p>
<p>Increase economic benefits, such as access to family wage jobs and
freight access</p>
<p>Ensure disadvantaged communities benefit as much or more than
non-disadvantaged communities</p>
<p>Reduce global warming pollution from transportation</p>
<p>Prioritize the most cost-effective projects</p>
<h1 id="master-street-plans">Master Street Plans</h1>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the master street plans is to increase the efficiency of
the transportation system through increased street connectivity and a
finer mesh of pedestrian and bikeways. A dense grid of streets helps
spread local vehicle trips more evenly over the local street network and
reduces congestion on the arterial system. Studies show that improved
local street connectivity improves arterial system capacity by as much
as 25 percent.</p>
<p>Studies show that distance is one of the most important factors in mode
choice. The lack of a dense grid of streets and pedestrian/bicycle
connections results in out-of-direction travel that is particularly
discouraging to potential pedestrians and bicyclists. The result is
increased use of the automobile for trips to nearby (as the crow flies)
destinations. Trips need to be relatively short <em>and direct</em> to
encourage travel on foot or by bicycle.</p>
<p>Good street connectivity improves emergency response times. Police,
fire, and ambulance services can reach their destinations more quickly
because there is less out-of-direction travel. Multiple access routes
can reduce travel times and provide access options if one route is
blocked.</p>
<p>Good local street connections can reduce traffic volumes on other
streets by spreading traffic over a denser network. With more
intersections, traffic also moves more slowly because side street
traffic and stop signs discourage drivers from speeding.</p>
<p>As properties are subdivided and developed, access needs are met
primarily through new streets. The City’s local street network has grown
over time, as outlying areas became more urbanized or older areas are
redeveloped. In the past, development was not always required to address
connections to adjacent areas as well as internal circulation. The
result has been large areas of the City with poor connectivity,
particularly in newer areas where the counties previously regulated
development.</p>
<p><strong>State Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Street connectivity must be part of transportation system plans (TSPs)
and adopting Ordinances. The Oregon Administrative Rule for State Land
Use Goal 12, Transportation, Section 660-012-0020, Elements of
Transportation Systems Plans, requires:</p>
<p>A road plan for a system of arterials and collectors and standards for
the layout of local streets and other important non-collector street
connections… The standards for the layout of local streets shall
provide for safe and convenient bike and pedestrian circulation
necessary to carry out OAR 660-012-045(3)(b).</p>
<p>The State Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) states that the intent of
the requirement is to provide guidance on the spacing of future
extensions and connections along existing and future streets that are
needed to provide reasonably direct routes for bicycle and pedestrian
travel.</p>
<p>The rule referenced above goes on to state:</p>
<p>On-site facilities shall be provided which accommodate safe and
convenient pedestrian and bicycle access from within new subdivisions,
multi-family developments, planned developments, shopping centers, and
commercial districts to adjacent residential areas and transit stops,
and to neighborhood activity centers within one-half mile of the
development. Single-family residential developments shall generally
include streets and accessways. Pedestrian circulation through parking
lots should generally be provided in the form of accessways.</p>
<p>The TPR also states that local jurisdictions should establish their own
standards or criteria for providing streets and accessways consistent
with the intent stated above. This may be accomplished through standards
for spacing of streets or accessways, and standards for excessive
out-of-direction travel. The TPR defines ‘safe and convenient’ access as
being:</p>
<p>● Reasonably free from hazards</p>
<p>● Meeting the needs of cyclists and pedestrians, considering destination
and length of trip</p>
<p><strong>Metro Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (RTFP), adopted in 2010
(Ordinance 10-1241B) and updated in 2012, requires jurisdictions to
implement two types of street plans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conceptual street plans that:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Map contiguous areas of vacant and redevelopable parcels of five or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>more acres planned or zoned for residential or mixed-use
development</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify appropriate connections to adjacent areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrate opportunities to extend and connect to existing streets,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>provide direct public right-of-way routes, and limit the potential
of cul-de-sac and other closed-end street designs</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. A street map for new residential or mixed-use development that will
require construction of a new street(s) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Responds to and expands on the conceptual street plan map</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides for street connections no further apart than 530 feet,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>except where prevented by barriers such as topography, railroads,
freeways, pre-existing development, or water features where
regulations do not allow construction of or prescribe different
standards for streets</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides bicycle and/or pedestrian connections when full street</p>
<blockquote>
<p>connections are not possible, no further apart than 330 feet,
except where prevented by barriers as noted above</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limits the use of cul-de-sac or closed street systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes street cross-sections</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Areas Meeting Connectivity Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Many areas of Portland meet the RTP connectivity standards or are not
required to have master street plans. The district maps in Chapter 2 of
the TSP (Maps 11.11.9-11.11.16) show these areas. Areas not required to
meet connectivity standards include industrial sanctuaries, open space,
and protected environmental areas. In Portland these are areas zoned
IG1, IG2, IH, OS, and p.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Master Street Plans</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Southwest and Far Southeast</em></strong></p>
<p>The City completed master street plans for the Southwest and Far
Southeast transportation districts in June 2001. These two master street
plans satisfy the State and regional requirements to identify the
location and type of new local street connections. The methodology and
criteria used to develop the plans are described briefly below. The SW
and Far SE Master Street Plan – Final Report and Recommendations
contains quarter-section level maps and tables that detail the
recommended connections. The report identifies three objectives to be
met:</p>
<p>● Reduce the uncertainty in the development review process regarding
when and where new street connections will be an issue.</p>
<p>● Provide for better coordination of the local street system
development.</p>
<p>● Comply with the mandates of the State Transportation Planning Rule and
Regional Transportation Plan for street connectivity.</p>
<p>The Southwest and Far Southeast master street plans were developed
through a number of steps, with mapping associated with each step:</p>
<p><em><br>
Step One</em></p>
<p>● Define blocks in the study area that meet the spacing standard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>● Define areas being excluded (areas where streets are complete or
underway; parcels zoned as park, open space, or industrial; religious
or educational institutions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Step Two</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>● Define remaining areas that have development or redevelopment
potential (land value greater than improvement value; different
Comprehensive Plan and zoning designations; two-acre or larger
parcels).</p>
<p>● Define development constraints (street spacing not met, but parcels
don’t meet development potential).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Step Three</em></p>
<p>● Define blocks with barriers to connectivity (environmentally
constrained).</p>
<p>*Step Four *</p>
<p>● Group the remaining areas into focus areas.</p>
<p>*Step Five *</p>
<p>● Define locations of new connections.</p>
<p>● Determine specificity of connections – specific points or along a
block face).</p>
<p>● Apply type of connection – street or pedestrian/bicycle.</p>
<p>The plan’s recommendations include information about the location, level
of alignment specificity, type of connection, barriers, presence of
environmental zones, traffic impacts, field notes, and comments from the
public or technical staff.</p>
<p>While the master street plans identify a number of future connections,
the absence of a connection does not mean a connection is not needed or
feasible. All areas within the study areas are still subject to relevant
policy and spacing standards.</p>
<p><strong><em>Area-Specific Master Street Plans</em></strong></p>
<p>Street plans have been completed, but not adopted into the Comprehensive
Plan, for other areas of the City over the past several years. Although
they are not specifically intended to meet the</p>
<p>State and regional requirements, they do function as master street
plans. These plans cover the following areas:</p>
<p>● Gateway Regional Center</p>
<p>● Airport Way (Columbia Corridor)</p>
<p>● Bridgeton (Northeast district adjacent to Marine Drive)</p>
<p>● South Portland (west end of the Ross Island Bridge)</p>
<p>● South Waterfront (Central City)</p>
<p>● River District (Central City)</p>
<p>● Cully Local Street Plan</p>
<p>● Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan</p>
<p>● Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</p>
<p>Each plan or study is summarized below, along with maps derived from the
original documents.</p>
<p><strong><em>Areas Not Covered by Master Street Plans</em></strong></p>
<p>Master Street plans have not been completed for all or parts of the
North, Northeast, Far Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Central City
districts. Other areas were excluded from the Southwest and Far
Southeast Master Street Plans: the east light rail corridor (102^nd^ to
the city limits, NE Glisan to SE Stark), the Hillsdale town center, and
the West Portland town center. Master Street plans for these areas will
be completed as refinement plans of the TSP. Until such plans are
completed, the location and implementation of new street and
pedestrian/bicycle connections will be governed by Title 17: Public
Improvements, and Title 33: Planning and Zoning, requirements in City
Code. Title 17 regulations govern developing or redeveloping sites that
do not include a land division, and Title 33 regulations govern
developing or redeveloping sites that do include a land division. The
spacing standards in each title are 530 feet for full street connections
and 330 feet for pedestrian/bicycle connections where full street
connections are not feasible.</p>
<p><strong>SOUTH WATERFRONT DISTRICT STREET PLAN, CRITERIA AND STANDARDS</strong></p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>In 1996, the Portland City Council accepted the City Engineer’s Report
titled North Macadam District Street Plan, which identified and
classified a street system for the North Macadam District. On January
20, 2003, City Council adopted amendments to the Central City Plan and
updated the District’s special design guidelines and the zoning code. At
the same time, City Council changed the North Macadam District name to
South Waterfront District (the District). By authority of the City
Engineer under Title 17 City Code, the South Waterfront Street Plan,
Criteria and Standards was amended in 2007 providing updated design
criteria and standard details for the District’s public rights-of-way.
The 2009 document update amends the North District (the area south of
Sheridan St and north of Gibbs St) rights-of-way alignment and standards
to accommodate future light rail and property development, as well as
expanded streetcar service and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
<p>The South Waterfront District of the Central City of Portland lies along
the Willamette River and south of downtown. The district boundaries are
the River, Interstate 5, the Marquam Bridge and SW Hamilton Court.
Adopted City policy envisions this as a mixed-use neighborhood with
significant residential development along the River and commercial
development focused along transit corridors. With just over one mile of
River frontage the District contains approximately 140 acres. Some land
is developed or being developed and some land is vacant land or has
redevelopment potential.</p>
<p>The primary development constraint in the District is transportation
access to and from regional highway and transit systems. The South
Waterfront Plan of January 20, 2003 includes a vision, policies and an
Urban Design Plan that promotes high density housing and commercial
development with a full range of businesses that contribute to the
region’s job growth. The vision also includes frequent public
connections to the river, limiting the size and amount of surface
parking lots, and integrating development and services.</p>
<p><img src="./media/image07.png" alt="" width="5.375in" height="8.354166666666666in"></p>
<p>In 1998 the North Macadam District Street Design Standards and Criteria
Plan: Transportation Report considered and analyzed South Waterfront’s
limited access and adjacency to I-5 and Ross Island Bridge ramps. The
analysis included the three district portal intersections: River Parkway
and Harbor Drive (north), Curry and Macadam (center) and Bancroft and
Macadam (south). The analysis was based on the District’s 20-year goals
for accommodating 10,000 jobs and 3,000 housing units and a 30 percent
mode split. The housing goal has since been increased to 5,000 units.</p>
<p>Conclusions were:</p>
<p>● Bancroft and Macadam portal improvements would accommodate traffic
growth and transit access at acceptable levels of service. South
Waterfront (North Macadam District) became part of the Central City in
1988.</p>
<p>● Moving the central portal from Gibbs to Curry and improving the Curry
and Macadam intersection would better accommodate traffic operation,
growth and access from I-5 to the District.</p>
<p>● As the District’s growth nears 10,000 jobs and 5,000 housing units,
portal access will degrade and as a result function at a marginally
acceptable level.</p>
<p>● River Parkway and Harbor Drive would operate at acceptable levels
although backups on I-5 and Naito Parkway could interfere with
operations on a more frequent basis in the future.</p>
<p>The 1998 transportation analysis demonstrated that while the District
will experience increased congestion over time, the portal capacity with
the identified portal improvements and increased transit service should
continue to provide acceptable levels of service to the District and the
regional transportation system.</p>
<p>Since the 1998 report, plans for portal improvements have been altered.
Through the South Portal Study, conducted in 2006, the recommended south
portal shifted south to Hamilton St and Macadam. In addition, the
planned central portal improvements at Curry have been scaled back and
north portal improvements at River Parkway and Harbor Drive have been
added. In fact, in 2009 the Portland Bureau of Transportation updated
the technical analysis through the North Macadam Transportation
Development Strategy (resolution no. 36696 adopted April 8, 2009). The
report identified multi-modal project priorities and a funding strategy
to guide project implementation necessary to support continued
development of the urban renewal area, including portal improvements.</p>
<p>The 2007 update of the South Waterfront District Street Plan, Criteria
and Standards primarily responded to development in the Central District
and completion of infrastructure projects, including the Portland
Streetcar extension to Lowell St and the Portland Aerial Tram to Oregon
Health Sciences University. Transportation studies, such as the 2004
South Waterfront District Transportation Improvements Evaluation and
2006 South Portal Study had also been completed. Major updates included
changes to the street lighting design standards, certain street
furniture standards, and the modification of the street plan based on
the recommendations of the South Portal Study and the new Greenstreet
Policy (resolution no. 36500 adopted in April of 2007). Other changes
included modest refinements to various street dimensional standards
developed through preliminary engineering and construction of these
streets and to refinements of various performance criteria. Overview
South Waterfront</p>
<p><strong>2009 Update</strong></p>
<p>Since the 2007 update, the City of Portland has endorsed the locally
Preferred Alternative (LPA) for the Portland to Milwaukie Light Rail
alignment. This alignment extended light rail south into the North
District and include bus service and streetcar utilizing the same
alignment. In addition, the OHSU Schnitzer Campus master plan and the
North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy report, with a
prioritized list of multi-modal projects and a funding strategy, have
been completed. These activities generated the need to refine and update
various elements of the Street Plan. Major updates include changes to
the street alignments and designations in the Concept Street Plan Map,
updates of some street widths in the Right-of-Way Width Map changes to
street descriptions in the Street Classification and Function Table, and
adjustments to the Standard Street Sections.</p>
<p>Specific changes made to the Concept Street Plan map are as follows:</p>
<p>● Bond Ave extends north through the District.</p>
<p>● Bond Ave is one-way northbound through the District.</p>
<p>● Moody Ave is one-way southbound for vehicular traffic through the
District; and one-way southbound for streetcar south of Woods St.</p>
<p>● Moody Ave remains two-way streetcar north of Woods St.</p>
<p>● Moody Ave includes a two-way bike path along the west-side to minimize
bike/streetcar interactions.</p>
<p>● The grades of Moody Ave and Porter St are raised to a level consistent
with the Willamette River Crossing Partnership findings necessary for
light rail.</p>
<p>● Porter St carries light rail, streetcar and bus in two directions
only; private vehicles are not accommodated on this street.</p>
<p>● River Pkwy (south of the Marquam Bridge) terminates at Woods St.</p>
<p>● Alignments are adjusted for local east-west streets north of Gibbs St.</p>
<p>● “Special Design Area” beneath the Ross Island Bridge has been
relocated to reflect the location of the potential active-use park.
Grover St is aligned on either side of the Ross Island Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>GATEWAY REGIONAL CENTER STREET PLAN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The 2040 Growth Concept identifies the Gateway regional center as the
only regional center in Portland. Planning for Gateway began with the
Outer Southeast Community Plan and continued with the Opportunity
Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy. City Council accepted
Opportunity Gateway in February 2000 (Resolution No. 35867). The Outer
Southeast Community Plan resulted in a plan district and
transit-supportive zoning</p>
<p>The Central Gateway portion of the Gateway District Master Street Plan
was amended in 2009. This amendment was based on a recommendation in the
Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy, which was adopted by the
Portland Development Commission in August 2007. The Central Gateway
Redevelopment Strategy concluded that the street plan for Central
Gateway should be updated, with the goal of increasing connectivity in
Central Gateway, providing greater certainty to developers about street
requirements and opening up parcels to redevelopment.</p>
<p><strong>Street Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>A discontinuous network of streets and sidewalks, high volumes of
through-traffic, and underutilized property characterize Gateway
regional center. Access to the transit stations in Gateway’s northwest
corner and at 102^nd^ and Burnside is problematic. Discontinuous streets
discourage walking and bicycling, resulting in significant
out-of-direction travel for all modes.</p>
<p>Increasing street connectivity would disperse trips among many alternate
routes, thereby reducing congestion, shortening trip lengths, and
increasing the mode split for alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<p><strong>Concept Plan Map</strong></p>
<p>The Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy is
intended to serve as the ‘appropriate vision’ for the redevelopment of
Gateway as a regional center. The concept plan map is a picture of the
regional center’s redevelopment potential and build-out in 2019. While
the plan map affixes buildings and parks to specific locations, the
reality is that new construction will appear somewhat differently. While
new streets and connections are identified, they are also subject to
change to respond to development opportunities. The Opportunity Gateway
report states: “It is rigid enough to be a statement of what is and is
not desirable in the</p>
<p>Regional Center, and flexible enough to be useful even as redevelopment
circumstances change.” The map graphically depicts the vision described
in the report.</p>
<p>The concept plan map calls for a traditional block configuration, which
will help unify the regional center’s character. Some of the proposed
new connections would greatly change existing circulation patterns.
Northeast Multnomah between Fred Meyer’s and Mervyn’s at the Gateway
Shopping Center is shown as a fully functional street, intended to help
disperse traffic associated with the transit center. In the southern
part of the regional center, several new public streets are shown in the
Mall 205 and Plaza 205 properties, breaking up what are now large
expanses of parking. Pedestrian pathways connect important routes and
destinations where full streets are not possible or appropriate, such as
between SE 105^th^ and the Adventist Medical Center.</p>
<p>As the major north-south arterial, 102^nd^ Avenue is the spine of the
district and is targeted for improvements for all modes. Changes to
99^th^ Avenue would allow it to act as an additional north-south
carrier, improving access for development projects and creating a new
local identity the length of the district. Major east-west streets
(Stark/Washington, Halsey/Weidler, Burnside, and Glisan) will continue
to carry significant volumes of through-traffic. Better local
north-south street connections will link the two main large shopping
areas together, and improved connectivity will be provided within each
of these shopping areas.</p>

<p><strong>Central Gateway Street Plan 2009</strong></p>
<p>The Central Gateway Master Street Plan revision was developed to provide
flexibility for connections while maintaining larger parcels for
redevelopment, recognizing existing parcel lines, provide connections on
the local network without altering the district or neighborhood
collectors and to foster redevelopment in the City’s only regional
Center. Criteria was established for consideration in the proposed plan.
Other goals of the plan included aligning streets on parcel boundaries
for shared investment in right-of-way improvements; consider common or
multiple parcel ownership; minimize parcel impacts and maintain reminder
parcels; preserve some large parcels or contiguous ownership parcels;
discourage cut-through traffic while providing access; discourage
off-set intersections; consider potential spacing of crosswalks or
signals.</p>
<p>With these criteria and goals, a revised street plan for Central Gateway
was developed. The revised street plan provided needed multi-modal
connections within the Central Gateway area without changing the
function of the major traffic streets and collectors surrounding the
area, such as 102nd Ave., Glisan, Burnside, and Stark.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the revised street plan:</p>
<p>East-west connections between 97th Ave. and 102nd Ave. on Flanders St.
and Davis St. North-south connection on 100th Ave. between Oak St. and
Burnside and also between Oregon St. and Pacific St.</p>
<p>North–south connection on 101st Ave. between Stark St. and approximately
Flanders St., improving multi-modal access to the light-rail station on
102nd and Burnside.</p>
<p>Internal connection on Oregon St. approximately Hoyt St., Coach St., and
101st Ave.</p>
<p>Vacating portions of 97th Ave. to allow developable parcels near I-205.
This would continue to allow multi-modal access to the parcels.</p>
<p>Maintaining existing large parcels for development and redevelopment
while also providing public bicycle and pedestrian access ways. Large
parcels would have the option to have public bike and pedestrian access
ways on the site rather than full streets, as was required in the prior
master street plan. Public bike and pedestrian access ways will be
required on certain blocks such that spacing of public connections shall
be no more than 330 feet where full street connections are more than 530
feet. Additionally, pedestrian connections would be required throughout
Central Gateway.</p>
<p>Because large parcels were maintained for development and redevelopment,
the revised street plan does not include some of the proposed streets
that were in the previous in the street plan for the Gateway District.
These include:</p>
<p>Extension of Oregon St. between 97th Ave. and 98th Ave. However, the
revised street plan proposes to keep the Irving St. alignment as
existing between 97th Ave. and 100th Ave., whereas the prior plan showed
this segment as vacated.</p>
<p>Full street connection of Hoyt St. between 97th Ave. and 104th Ave.</p>
<p>Full street connection of roughly the Davis St. alignment between 97th
Ave. and 103rd Ave. The revised street plan proposes that some portions
of the alignment would be full street while other portions would be
pedestrian connection.</p>
<p>Extension of 101st Ave. between Washington St. and Pacific St. The
revised street plan proposes a mix of full streets and pedestrian
connections on some portions of the 101st Ave. alignment. Other portions
of the alignment would not have connections. Unlike as in the prior
plan, the revised street plan does not intend for 10st Ave. to become a
neighborhood collector. Rather, 99th Ave. would be a through street,
with 100th Ave. also providing significant connectivity.)</p>
<p>Extension of 100th Ave. between Oak St. and Washington St. (The revised
street plan does not include any connectivity at this location.
Vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles could access the area from
connections at 97th Ave., and 101st.</p>
<p><strong>Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan (2012)</strong></p>
<p>The Cully Commercial Corridor and Local Street Plan was adopted by
Resolution 36952 in August 2012. Its development was funded by a
Transportation Growth Management Grant from the Oregon Department of
Transportation. Its recommendations were also influenced by the Portland
Plan (April 2012) which had recommendations related to alternative right
of way improvements, developing new options for unimproved rights-of-way
and accelerating the creation of safe pedestrian connections. The Cully
Neighborhood Local Street Plan identified new street or
pedestrian/bicycle connections to improve street connectivity and
address gaps in transportation networks.</p>

<p><strong>FAR SOUTHEAST PORTLAND MASTER STREET PLAN</strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Area</strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast Portland Master Street Plan includes nearly all of the
Far Southeast Transportation District, from I-205 east to the City
limit, and from Burnside south to the City limits. Some portions of this
area are excluded from the plan: the Gateway regional center because a
street plan already exists, and Burnside light rail station areas
(102^nd^ to 162^nd^,</p>
<p>NE Glisan to SE Stark), where master street plans will be completed as
part of TSP refinement plans.</p>
<p><strong><em>Land Use</em></strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast is predominantly in residential use, with interspersed
commercial/retail uses. Commercial/retail uses are located in strip
commercial development along arterials such as 122^nd^ and Division or
in malls such as Mall 205 or the San Rafael Shopping Center.
Institutions, such as colleges, hospitals, and schools, can create
barriers, but offer limited opportunities for street connections.
Cemeteries and parks also occupy significant tracts of land in the
district. There are only a few pockets of industrial uses, principally
near the Lents town center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zoning</em></strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast Master Street Plan Study area includes virtually all
of the various City commercial zones, except some designed specifically
for the Central City. The area includes nearly all the residential
zones, excluding only the most dense zones. The employment and
industrial zoning currently in place is confined primarily to the
southern edge of the district. Significant tracts of open space zoning
exist, with Powell Butte the largest. Environmental overlays are applied
to areas with steep slopes and near streams and wetland areas,
principally in the southeast portion of the district.</p>
<p><strong><em>Area Character</em></strong></p>
<p>Terrain and the density of development largely determine the area’s
character. Some less developed areas display a rural appearance, with
open fields and large out-buildings. The majority of the district has a
more suburban appearance, with large tracts of single-dwelling homes on
medium to large lots. Some areas display a more urban character, with
smaller lots and buildings closer to the street. Steep slopes with
numerous streams and gullies are located in the southern portion of the
area, along Johnson Creek and in Pleasant Valley.</p>
<p>Long-term county stewardship, along with recent population growth, has
resulted in relatively few public streets in some areas, and large
redevelopable parcels of land. Many of the area’s local service streets
and collectors are not fully improved. The lack of sidewalks results in
a street system that is not particularly pedestrian friendly. The lack
of public streets contributes significantly to out-of-direction travel
patterns, and very wide major arterials carry many local trips as well
as through-trips.</p>
<p><strong>Issues and Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Barriers (such as terrain, streams, and existing development) will
continue to limit a connected street system, including
bicycle/pedestrian accessways, in Far Southeast Portland. With expected
increases in the number of households and dwelling units in the area,
however, completion of the local street system will be needed even more
to provide multimodal access to areas of new development and from those
areas to neighborhood activity centers, transit, and arterials.</p>
<p><strong>Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design (2012)</strong></p>
<p>The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation, in coordination with the
Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), developed a conceptual
design plan for Outer SE Powell Blvd. from the I-205 to SE 174th Ave
(city limits). This stretch of SE Powell Blvd is designated State
Highway No. 26. Therefore, ODOT has jurisdiction along SE Powell Blvd.</p>
<p>The plan addressed the needs for Outer Powell Blvd in a 20-year time
frame. The plan identified improvements and right-of-way width needs
that will allow Outer SE Powell Blvd to serve vehicle traffic movement
while also improving the safety, accessibility and the aesthetic
environment for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders. The Outer
Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design was adopted by Resolution 36931 in
February 2013.</p>
<p>A component of the plan was improving local connectivity around Powell
Blvd. A Local Streets and Access-ways Report identified additional
connections in the area.</p>
<p>Six types of connections were identified in the Local Streets and
Accessways Report.</p>
<p>Separated In-Roadway Bicycle Facilities. Facilities that separate the
bicycle travel lane from the motor vehicle lane with striping or a
physical barrier. Examples are a standard bike lane, buffered bike lane,
and cycle track.</p>
<p>Bicycle Boulevards/Advisory Bike Lanes. Facilities on low traffic volume
streets where through movements of bicycles is given priority over motor
vehicles Advisory bike lanes include dashed bike lane striping and
single motor vehicle lane. Vehicles are allowed to enter bike lanes to
pass each other.</p>
<p>Pedestrian and Bicycle Pathways. These facilities are outside of the
roadway right-of way and fully separated from the roadway.</p>
<p>Street Connections. New local streets built to City standards. Sidewalks
accommodate pedestrian travel and bike travel share the roadway with
vehicles.</p>
<p>Pedestrian and Bicycle Crossings. Two types of crossings were
identified. The first type is provided by the existing traffic signals.
New signals were not recommended. The second crossing type is shown at
generally desired locations between signalized intersections. Specific
design treatments were not determined (e.g. pedestrian refuge island,
HAWK signal, etc.)</p>
<p>Potential Street Realignment. Opportunities to realign existing streets
through future redevelopment. The objective is to align intersections on
opposite sides of Powell Boulevard to improve pedestrian crossings or
access to transit stops.</p>
<p><strong>Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan</strong> (Adopted by Resolution No.
37157 October 15, 2015)</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), in partnership with the
Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and Oregon Department of
Transportation (ODOT), developed the Division-Midway Neighborhood Street
Plan. The Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan was developed to help
improve local street and pathway connectivity in several East Portland
neighborhoods. The project area is centered on SE Division Street, a
designated “Main Street” in the Metro Region 2040 Growth Concept Plan
and the study area was bounded by SE 112th Ave, SE 148th Ave, SE Stark
and SE Holgate and includes portions of the Hazelwood, Mill Park,
Centennial and Powellhurst Gilbert neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Goals and Objectives: The overall goal is to develop a Neighborhood
Street Plan that can better increase street connectivity and multi-modal
travel options within the project area. Objectives:</p>
<p>● Establish a more connected local street and path network</p>
<p>● Create safer walking and bicycling routes to neighborhood
destinations, transit and the regionally designated SE Division Main
Street</p>
<p>● Define the range of options for improving local streets, including use
of Portland Street By Street design options.</p>
<p>● Inform future improvements to be built over-time by property owners,
developers and the City.</p>
<p>The Street Plan identified implementation methods for introducing new
street and pathway connections and options for improving deficient local
streets. The plan recommended adding New Future Public Connections
across Existing Private Property.</p>

<p><strong>Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</strong></p>
<p>(Adopted by Resolution No. 37162, November 2015)</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) and the Portland Bureau of
Environmental Services (BES) developed the Tryon-Stephens Headwaters
Neighborhood Street Plan to create a strategy to complete the
transportation network and stormwater system within the study area. The
Tryon-Stephens plan provides a strategy for enhancing neighborhood
access to local destinations by looking comprehensively at street and
drainage issues. The Tryon-Stephens Street Plan sets a framework for
tailoring improvements to individual streets based on the adjacent land
use, street character, and natural setting.</p>
<p>The plan recommends modifying the City of Portland’s Southwest Master
Street Plan (2001) to add future local street/pathway connections in two
locations within the study area, as shown on the following map (page 52
of the Tryon-Stevens plan). Recommended new connections are in the
Hillsdale neighborhood linking SW Nevada Court to SW Vermont Street
between SW 26th Avenue and Capitol Hill Road, and in the Markham
Neighborhood linking SW Marigold Street between SW 23rd and SW 26th
Avenues.</p>

<p><strong>Objective 9.2 Street Classification Descriptions (formerly Objective
6.4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.2.a.</strong> Classification descriptions and designations are used to
determine the appropriateness of street improvements and to make
recommendations on new and expanding land uses through the land use
review processes.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.b.</strong> Classification descriptions are used to describe how streets
should function for each mode of travel, not necessarily how they are
functioning at present.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.c.</strong> All of a street’s classifications must be considered in
designing street improvements and allocating funding. While a proposed
project may serve only one classification, improvements should not
preclude future modifications to accommodate other classifications of
the street.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.d.</strong> When the existing use of a street does not comply with its
classification, no additional investments should be made that encourage
that inappropriate use.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.e.</strong> Designate new streets within a land division site as Local
Service Streets for all modes unless otherwise designated through a
concurrent or subsequent Comprehensive Plan amendment to the
Transportation Element.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.f.</strong> Designate new streets within Pedestrian Districts and Freight
Districts as Local Service Streets unless otherwise designated through a
Comprehensive Plan amendment to the Transportation Element.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 9.3 Traffic Classification Descriptions (formerly Objective
6.5)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.3.a.</strong> <strong>Regional Trafficways</strong> serve interregional district
movement that has only one trip end in a transportation district or to
serve trips that bypass a district completely.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Regional Trafficways should serve the Central
City, regional centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities
and should connect key freight routes within the region to points
outside the region. Encourage private and public development of
regional significance to locate adjacent to Regional
Trafficway interchanges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Regional Trafficways should connect to other Regional
Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, and District Collectors. A
ramp that connects to a Regional Trafficway is classified as a
Regional Trafficway from its point of connection up to its
intersection with a lower-classified street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffering. Adjacent neighborhoods should be buffered from the
impacts of Regional Trafficways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Classification. A street with dual Regional Trafficway and
Major City Traffic Street classifications should retain the
operational characteristics of a Major City Traffic Street and
respond to adjacent land uses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.b.</strong> <strong>Major City Traffic Streets</strong> serve as the principal routes
for traffic that has at least one trip end within a transportation
district.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Major City Traffic Streets should provide
motor vehicle connections among the Central City, regional centers,
town centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities.
Auto-oriented development should locate adjacent to Major City
Traffic Streets, but should orient to pedestrians along streets also
classified as Transit Streets or within Pedestrian Districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Major City Traffic Streets should serve as primary
connections to Regional Trafficways and serve major activity centers
in each district. Traffic with no trip ends within a transportation
district should be discouraged from using Major City
Traffic Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-Street Parking. On-street parking may be removed and additional
right-of-way purchased to provide adequate traffic access when
consistent with the street design designation of the street.
Evaluate the need for on-street parking to serve adjacent land uses
and improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists when making
changes to the roadway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.c.</strong> <strong>Traffic Access Streets</strong> provide access to Central City
destinations, distribute traffic within a Central City district, provide
connections between Central City districts, and distribute traffic from
Regional Trafficways and Major City Traffic Streets for access within
the district. Traffic Access Streets are not intended for
through-traffic with no trip ends in the district.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Traffic Access Streets serve Central City
land uses. Solutions to congestion problems on Traffic Access
Streets must accommodate the high-density pattern desired in the
Central City.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Connections to adjoining transportation districts
should be to District or Neighborhood Collectors. Intersections of
Traffic Access Streets and streets with higher or similar
classifications should be signalized, where warranted, to facilitate
the safe movement of traffic along each street as well as turning
movements from one street to the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access. Reduction in motor vehicle congestion is given less priority
than: supporting pedestrian access and enhancing the pedestrian
environment; maintaining on-street parking to support land uses;
accommodating transit; or accommodating bicycles. Access to
off-street parking is allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-of-way Acquisition. Acquisition of additional right-of-way to
reduce congestion is discouraged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.d.</strong> <strong>District Collectors</strong> serve as distributors of traffic from
Major City Traffic Streets to streets of the same or lower
classification. District Collectors serve trips that both start and end
within a district.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. District Collectors generally connect town
centers, corridors, main streets, and neighborhoods to nearby
regional centers and other major destinations. Land uses that
attract trips from the surrounding neighborhoods or from throughout
the district should be encouraged to locate on District Collectors.
Regional attractors of traffic should be discouraged from locating
on District Collectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. District Collectors should connect to Major City
Traffic Streets, other collectors, and local streets and, where
necessary, to Regional Trafficways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-Street Parking. Removal of on-street parking and right-of-way
acquisition should be discouraged on District Collectors, except at
specific problem locations to accommodate the equally important
functions of traffic movement and vehicle access to
abutting properties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.e.</strong> <strong>Neighborhood Collectors</strong> serve as distributors of traffic
from Major City Traffic Streets or District Collectors to Local Service
Streets and to serve trips that both start and end within areas bounded
by Major City Traffic Streets and District Collectors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Neighborhood Collectors should connect
neighborhoods to nearby centers, corridors, station communities,
main streets, and other nearby destinations. New land uses and major
expansions of land uses that attract a significant volume of traffic
from outside the neighborhood should be discouraged from locating on
Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Neighborhood Collectors should connect to Major City
Traffic Streets, District Collectors, and other Neighborhood
Collectors, as well as to Local Service Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. The design of Neighborhood Collectors may vary over their
length as the land use character changes from primarily commercial
to primarily residential. Some Neighborhood Collectors may have a
regional function, either alone or in concert with other nearby
parallel collectors. All Neighborhood Collectors should be designed
to operate as neighborhood streets rather than as
regional arterials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-Street Parking. The removal of on-street parking and right-of-way
acquisition should be discouraged on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.f.</strong> <strong>Local Service Traffic Streets</strong> distribute local traffic
and provide access to local residences or commercial uses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Discourage auto-oriented land uses from using
Local Service Traffic Streets as their primary access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classification. Streets not classified as Regional Trafficways,
Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, or Neighborhood
Collectors are classified as Local Service Traffic Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Local Service Traffic Streets should connect
neighborhoods, provide local circulation, and provide access to
nearby centers, corridors, station areas, and main streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Local Service Traffic Streets provide local circulation
for traffic, pedestrians, and bicyclists and (except in
special circumstances) should provide on-street parking. In some
instances, where vehicle speeds and volumes are very low (for
example, woonerfs and accessways), Local Service Traffic Streets may
accommodate both vehicles and pedestrians and bicyclists in a
shared space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective 9.4 Transit Classification Descriptions (formerly Objective
6.6)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.4.a.</strong> <strong>Regional Transitways</strong> provide for interregional and
interdistrict transit trips with frequent, high speed, high-capacity,
express, or limited service, and to connect the Central City with all
regional centers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Development with a regional attraction (e.g., shopping
centers, arenas) are encouraged to locate adjacent to Regional
Transitways to reduce traffic impacts on adjoining areas
and streets. Locate high-density development within a half-mile of
transit stations on Regional Transitways, with the highest densities
closest to the stations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Transit. Transit stations should be designed to
accommodate a high level of multimodal access within a half-mile
radius of the station. Use feeder bus service to access Regional
Transit stations. Use park-and-ride facilities to access Regional
Transit stations only at ends of Regional Transitways or where
adequate feeder bus service is not feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Use transit-preferential treatments to facilitate
light rail and bus operations. Consider the use of access management
measures to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and
other vehicles. Where compatible with adjacent land uses,
right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate
transit-preferential measures and improve access to transit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer Points. Provide safe and convenient transfer points with
covered waiting areas with transit route information, benches, trash
receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus Stops. Buses providing local service along Regional Transitways
should have more frequent stop spacing, similar to stop spacing
along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Classification. A street with a dual Regional Transitway and
Major Transit Priority Street classifications should retain the
operational characteristics of a Major Transit Priority Street and
respond to adjacent land uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. A ramp that connects to a Regional Transitway is
classified as a Regional Transitway up to its intersection with a
lower-classified street.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.b. Major Transit Priority Streets</strong> provide for high-quality
transit service that connects the Central City and other regional and
town centers and main streets.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Transit-oriented land uses should be encouraged to locate
along Major Transit Priority Streets, especially in centers.
Discourage auto-oriented development from locating on a Major
Transit Priority Street, except where the street is outside the
Central City, regional or town center, station community, or main
street and is also classified as a Major City Traffic Street.
Support land use densities that vary directly with the existing and
planned capacity of transit service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Transit. Provide safe and convenient access for
pedestrians and bicyclists to, across, and along Major Transit
Priority Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Employ transit-preferential measures, such as signal
priority and bypass lanes. Where compatible with adjacent land use
designations, right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur
to accommodate transit-preferential measures or improve access
to transit. The use of access management should be considered where
needed to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and
other vehicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer Points. Provide safe and convenient transfer points with
covered waiting areas, transit route information, benches, trash
receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones. Limited
transit service should stop at transfer points and activity centers
along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Classification. Streets with dual Regional Transitway and Major
Transit Priority Street classifications should retain the
operational characteristics of Major Transit Priority Streets, and
development should orient to the street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus Stops. Locate bus stops to provide convenient access to
neighborhoods and commercial centers. Stops should be located
relatively close together in high-density and medium-density areas,
including regional and town centers and along most main streets, and
relatively farther apart in lower-density areas. Passenger amenities
should include shelters and route information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.c. Transit Access Streets</strong> are intended for district-oriented
transit service serving main streets, neighborhoods, and commercial,
industrial, and employment areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Encourage pedestrian- and transit-oriented development in
commercial, institutional, and mixed-use areas along Transit
Access Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Transit. Provide safe and convenient pedestrian and
bicycle access to transfer points and stops and along Transit
Access Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer Points. Provide bus shelters, safe and convenient
pedestrian crossings, and transit information at transfer points.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>9.5.a. Major City Bikeways</strong> form the backbone of the city’s bikeway
network and are intended to serve high volumes of bicycle traffic and
provide direct, seamless, efficient travel across and between
transportation districts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Major City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Major City Bikeways should be designed to accommodate
large volumes of bicyclists, to maximize their comfort and to
minimize delays by emphasizing the movement of bicycles. Build the
highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and
on-street parking may be removed on Major City Bikeways to provide
needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible
with adjacent land uses and only after performing careful analysis
to determine potential impacts to the essential movement of
all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are
needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider
alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or
dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On
Major City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all
appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines.
Where conditions warrant and where practical, Major City Bikeways
should have separated facilities for bicycles and pedestrians.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9.5.c. Local Service Bikeways</strong> serve local circulation needs for
bicyclists and provide access to adjacent properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classification. All streets not classified as City Bikeways or Major
City Bikeways with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also
classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local
Service Bikeways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Consider the following design treatments for Local
Service Bikeways: shared roadways, traffic calming, bicycle lanes,
and extra-wide curb lanes. Crossings of Local Service Bikeways with
other rights-of-way should minimize conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-Street Parking. On-street parking on Local Service Bikeways
should not be removed to provide bicycle lanes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operation. Treatment of Local Service Bikeways should not have a
side effect of creating, accommodating, or encouraging
automobile through-traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.5.d. Bicycle Districts</strong> are areas with a dense concentration of
commercial, cultural, institutional and/or recreational destinations
where the City intends to make bicycle travel more attractive than
driving.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. High density and mixed-use neighborhoods should be
targeted as bicycle districts. Auto-oriented development should be
discouraged in Bicycle Districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characteristics. The size and configuration of a Bicycle District
should be consistent with the scale of bicycling trips. A Bicycle
District includes the streets along its boundaries, except where the
abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. All streets within a Bicycle District are important in
serving bicycle trips. Appropriate bicycle facilities should be
determined for each street based on the desired bicycling conditions
and operations. Use the bikeway design and engineering guidelines to
design streets within Bicycle Districts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective 9.6 Pedestrian Classification Descriptions (formerly
Objective 6.8)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.6.a. Pedestrian Districts</strong> give priority to pedestrian access in
areas where high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned,
including the Central City, Gateway regional center, town centers, and
station communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Zoning should allow a transit-supportive density of
residential and commercial uses that support lively and intensive
pedestrian activity. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged
in Pedestrian Districts. Institutional campuses that generate high
levels of pedestrian activity may be included in
Pedestrian Districts. Exceptions to the density and zoning criteria
may be appropriate in some designated historic districts with a
strong pedestrian orientation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streets within a District. Make walking the mode of choice for all
trips within a Pedestrian District. All streets within a Pedestrian
District are equal in importance in serving pedestrian trips and
should have sidewalks on both sides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characteristics. The size and configuration of a Pedestrian District
should be consistent with the scale of walking trips. A Pedestrian
District includes both sides of the streets along its boundaries,
except where the abutting street is classified as a
Regional Trafficway. In these instances, the land up to the Regional
Trafficway is considered part of the Pedestrian District, but the
Regional Trafficway itself is not.</p>

to have, frequent transit service and convenient access to
transit stops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design streets
within Pedestrian Districts. Improvements may include widened
sidewalks, curb extensions, street lighting, street trees,
and signing. Where two arterials cross, design treatments such as
curb extensions, median pedestrian refuges, marked crosswalks, and
traffic signals should be considered to minimize the crossing
distance, direct pedestrians across the safest route, and provide
safe gaps in the traffic stream.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.6.b. Pedestrian-Transit Streets</strong> create a strong and visible
relationship between pedestrians and transit within the Central City.</p>
<ul>

accommodate high levels of pedestrian traffic, urban design features
that promote pedestrian activity, and visual signals to motor
vehicles to recognize the priority of pedestrian and
transit vehicles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.6.c. City Walkways</strong> provide safe, convenient, and attractive
pedestrian access to activities along major streets and to recreation
and institutions; provide connections between neighborhoods; and provide
access to transit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. City Walkways should serve areas with dense zoning,
commercial areas, and major destinations. Where auto-oriented land
uses are allowed on City Walkways, site development standards should
address the needs of pedestrians for access.</p>
</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Function. Use Off-Street Paths as short cuts to link urban
destinations and origins along continuous greenbelts such as rivers,
park and forest areas, and other scenic corridors, and used as
elements of a regional, citywide, or community recreational
trail plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Location. Establish Off-Street Paths in corridors not well served by
the street system. On existing rights-of-way that are not developed
or likely to be developed in the near future, Off-Street Paths may
be designated where needed to complete the pedestrian system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design
Off-Street Paths. Design Off-Street Paths as separated facilities
that accommodate pedestrians and may accommodate other
non-motorized vehicles.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective 9.9 Street Design Classification Descriptions (formerly
Objective 6.11)</strong></p>
<p>Street Design Classification Descriptions provide general design
guidance based on the current and planned land use context around the
street. Whenever possible, a “complete streets” approach should be taken
during street design to accommodate all necessary modes and functions,
taking into account the modal classifications. Where right-of-way is
limited and tradeoffs must be made, refer to the modal street
classifications as well as Policy 9.6 (Transportation strategy for
people movement) to help guide decision-making regarding allocation of
right-of-way. If one or more modes are still unable to be accommodated
in the available right-of-way, a “complete networks” approach should be
used to ensure that those modes are still accommodated on parallel
routes as a part of project design.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.e. Regional Corridors</strong> serve people throughout the City and are
designed to emphasize multimodal mobility between cities in the region.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Regional Corridors connect Regional, Town, and
Neighborhood Centers to other cities in the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lanes. Regional Corridors usually include two to four vehicle lanes.
They occasionally have additional lanes in some situations, such as
to allow turning movements. Lanes may be dedicated as transit-only
or business-access-transit lanes if needed to improve transit speed
and reliability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Width. Regional Corridors generally feature a wider right-of-way
than Community Corridors and are more often able to provide the full
desired space for each mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Regional Corridors emphasize mobility for all modes
between cities while also accommodating access to adjacent land uses
along the corridor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curb zone. The curb zone along Regional Corridors should emphasize
mobility functions such as bicycle facilities or turn lanes
near intersections. The curb zone may be used for access functions
such as parking and loading if needed to support adjacent land use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separation. Regional Corridors can have moderately spaced
street connections. Sidewalks should be provided and pedestrian and
bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median
refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety
and comfort. Bicycle facilities should be separated from motor
vehicle traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Elements. Regional Corridor design should typically include
the following: sidewalks; pedestrian crossings where needed to serve
transit stops or destinations; separated bicycle facilities;
way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes;
and medians and/or turn lanes as needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.f. Community Corridors</strong> primarily serve surrounding neighborhoods
and are designed to emphasize multimodal mobility between neighborhoods.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Community Corridors connect Regional, Town, and
Neighborhood Centers to surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lanes. Lanes may be dedicated as transit-only or
business-access-transit lanes if needed to improve transit speed
and reliability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Width. Community Corridors generally feature a narrower right-of-way
than Regional Corridors and may not be able to accommodate the full
desired space for each mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Community Corridors emphasize mobility for all modes
between neighborhoods while also accommodating access to adjacent
land uses along the corridor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curb zone. The curb zone along Community Corridors should emphasize
mobility functions such as bicycle facilities or turn lanes
near intersections. The curb zone may be used for access functions
such as parking and loading if needed to support adjacent land use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separation. Community Corridors have closely spaced
street connections. Sidewalks should be provided and pedestrian and
bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median
refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety
and comfort. Bicycle facilities should be separated from motor
vehicle traffic, though shared roadway bicycle facilities may be
acceptable if traffic volumes and speeds are sufficiently low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Elements. Community Corridor design should typically include
the following: sidewalks; pedestrian crossings where needed to serve
transit stops or destinations; separated bicycle facilities;
way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes;

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.g. Urban Throughways</strong> are designed to emphasize long-distance
mobility for motor vehicle, freight, and transit trips throughout the
region.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Urban Throughways connect major activity centers,
industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Adjacent land uses
sometimes orient directly to Urban Throughways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of Lanes. Urban Throughways usually have four to six vehicle
lanes, with additional lanes in some situations. Dedicated
high-occupancy-vehicle, freight-only, or transit-only lanes may be
provided to support more efficient use of Urban Throughways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Urban Throughways primarily serve a mobility function,
with little or no local access provided along the street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separation. Urban Throughways may be completely divided, with no
left turns, or they may be mostly divided, with limited
opportunities for left turns. Street connections may occur at
separated grades, with access controlled by ramps, or there may be
limited street connections at grade. If designed as a
grade-separated freeway, pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be
provided on overpasses or underpasses, and pedestrian and bicycle
facilities along the corridor should be provided on
parallel pathways. If designed as a limited-access highway or
expressway, pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be either
grade-separated or signalized, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities
should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Elements. Urban Throughway design typically includes vehicle
lanes, grade-separated or signalized pedestrian and bicycle,
parallel pathways or separated facilities for pedestrian and bicycle
travel, clear sightlines, median barriers, shoulders, and motor
vehicle lane widths that accommodate freight movement. Where
appropriate, transit priority treatments should be used to enhance
transit speed and reliability. Encourage the Oregon Department of
Transportation to maintain a continuous landscape along Urban
Throughways that reduces the visual impacts of the throughway on
motorists and adjacent land uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. A ramp that connects to an Urban Throughway is
classified as an Urban Throughway up to its intersection with a
differently-classified street. An interchange between an Urban
Throughway and a differently-classified street should be designed to
safely accommodate all modes and provide the least possible
disruption to the surrounding modal networks. Connections should be
provided across Urban Throughways at closely-spaced intervals to
provide greater street connectivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.h. Industrial Roads</strong> are designed to emphasize freight mobility
while also accommodating other modes and providing local access.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Industrial Roads typically serve industrial areas and
freight intermodal sites, with a significant percentage of trips
being made by trucks. Adjacent land uses sometimes orient to the
Industrial Road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of Lanes. Industrial Road design typically includes two to
four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed.
Dedicated freight-only lanes or turn pockets may be provided as
needed to support roadway efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Industrial Roads emphasize freight mobility while
accommodating other modes and providing access to industrial sites
and freight districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curb zone. The curb zone along Industrial Roads primarily serves
mobility functions such as vehicle lanes or bike lanes. The curb
zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading at
limited locations if needed to support adjacent land use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separation. Industrial Roads have limited street connections that
may occur at the same grade or separate grades. Pedestrian and
bicycle crossings should be grade-separated or signalized, and
pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be separated from motor
vehicle traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Elements. Industrial Road design typically includes vehicle
lanes, medians or center turn lanes where needed, limited driveway
access, pullouts for bus stops, transit priority treatments,
separated pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and improved pedestrian
crossings located on overpasses, underpasses, or signalized
at-grade intersections. Industrial Roads may also include design
treatments that improve freight mobility, such as freight-only
lanes, freight signal priority, and a wider turning radius
at intersections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.i. Enhanced Greenway Corridors</strong> are designed to provide a network
of scenic low-stress connections that prioritize walking and/or
bicycling and often include natural features as well as innovative urban
design and place-making elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dual Classification. Streets may have an Enhanced Greenway Corridor
classification in addition to another street design classification.
When developing or retrofitting these streets, incorporate Enhanced
Greenway Corridor design elements within the corridor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Enhanced Greenway Corridors connect parks, open spaces,
and singular attractions throughout the City to each other and to
surrounding neighborhoods via a network of scenic and low-stress
walking and/or bicycling routes. They can run through a variety of
different land use contexts, including residential neighborhoods,
natural areas, industrial areas, and employment centers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Elements. Enhanced Greenway Corridor design can take many
forms, and should use flexible design treatments appropriate to
adjacent land use context. Design elements may include: neighborhood
greenways; traffic calming; motor vehicle diversion; multi-use
paths; wide sidewalks; boardwalks; trails; separated bikeways;
broad-canopy trees and landscaping; scenic views; stormwater
management; underground utilities; special lighting;
and way-finding. Where appropriate, pedestrian and bicycle routes
may use separate parallel routes or streets along a corridor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.j. Greenscape Streets</strong></p>
<p>Greenscape Street designs are applied to arterials where natural or
informal landscapes dominate the adjacent areas and the right-of-way,
such as lower-density residential areas in wooded settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dual Classifications. Where streets have a Greenscape Street design
designation and another street design designation, consider the
natural characteristics of the street during the design and
implementation of street improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Treatment. During improvement projects, consider the use of
vegetated stormwater treatment techniques; minimizing impervious
surfaces; preservation of existing vegetation, topography, vistas
and viewpoints, driver perception, street lighting, and sight
distance requirements. Vegetation may be landscaped or native,
depending on the existing and desired character.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.k. Local Streets</strong> are designed to complement planned land uses
and reduce dependence on arterials for local circulation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Local Streets are multimodal, but are not intended for
trucks (other than local deliveries) in residential areas. Local
Streets are important for local circulation of trucks in commercial
and industrial areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design. Local Street design typically includes frequent street
connections, sidewalks, on-street parking, stormwater facilities,
and planting of street trees and ground covers (where planting
strips are included). A shared street design without sidewalks may
be appropriate where traffic volumes are sufficiently low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classification. All streets not classified as Urban Throughways,
Urban Highways, Industrial Roads, Civic Main Streets, Neighborhood
Main Streets, Civic Corridors, Neighborhood Corridors, Regional
Corridors, or Community Corridors are classified as Local Streets
for street design.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="policies">Policies</h1>
<p><strong>Design and planning</strong></p>
<p>The City of Portland’s transportation system is a key public facility.
The following policies describe what the transportation system is, what
it does, and what factors to consider in how the overall system is used.
<em>Policies 8.1-8.60 in Chapter 8: Public Facilities and Services also
apply to the need for quality facilities and services, multiple
benefits, reliability, and creating a multi-purpose and safe
right-of-way.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.1 Street design classifications.</strong> Maintain and implement
street design classifications consistent with land use plans,
environmental context, urban design pattern areas, and the Neighborhood
Corridor and Civic Corridor Urban Design Framework designations.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.2 Street policy classifications.</strong> Maintain and implement
street policy classifications for pedestrian, bicycle, transit, freight,
emergency vehicle, and automotive movement, while considering access for
all modes, connectivity, adjacent planned land uses, and state and
regional requirements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>9.2.a.</strong> Designate district classifications that emphasize freight
mobility and access in industrial and employment areas serving high
levels of truck traffic and to accommodate the needs of intermodal
freight movement.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.b.</strong> Designate district classifications that give priority to
pedestrian access in areas where high levels of pedestrian activity
exist or are planned, including the Central City, Gateway regional
center, town centers, neighborhood centers, and transit station
areas.<br>
<br>
<strong>9.2.c.</strong> Designate district classifications that give priority to
bicycle access and mobility in areas where high levels of bicycle
activity exist or are planned, including Downtown, the River District,
Lloyd District, Gateway Regional Center, town centers, neighborhood
centers, and transit station areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Policy 9.3 Transportation System Plan.</strong> Maintain and implement the
Transportation System Plan (TSP) as the decision-making tool for
transportation-related projects, policies, programs, and street design.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.4 Use of classifications.</strong> Plan, develop, implement, and
manage the transportation system in accordance with street design and
policy classifications outlined in the Transportation System Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.5</strong> <strong>Mode share goals and Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT)

low-carbon transportation modes. Reduce VMT to achieve targets set in
the most current Climate Action Plan and Transportation System Plan, and
meet or exceed Metro’s mode share and VMT targets.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.6 Transportation strategy for people movement.</strong> Implement a
prioritization of modes for people movement by making transportation
system decisions according to the following ordered list:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Walking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bicycling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxi / commercial transit / shared vehicles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero emission vehicles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other single-occupant vehicles</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When implementing this prioritization, ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The needs and safety of each group of users are considered, and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>changes do not make existing conditions worse for the most
vulnerable users higher on the ordered list.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>All users’ needs are balanced with the intent of optimizing the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>right of way for multiple modes on the same street.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>When necessary to ensure safety, accommodate some users on parallel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>streets as part of a multi-street corridor.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land use and system plans, network functionality for all modes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>other street functions, and complete street policies,
are maintained.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy-based rationale is provided if modes lower in the ordered</p>
<blockquote>
<p>list are prioritized.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Specific modal policies are found below in policies 9.17 to 9.40.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.7 Moving goods and delivering services.</strong> In tandem with
people movement, maintain efficient and reliable movement of goods and
services as a critical transportation system function. Prioritize
freight system reliability improvements over single-occupancy vehicle
mobility where there are solutions that distinctly address those
different needs. <em>Multimodal freight policies are found below in
policies 9.33 to 9.35.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.8</strong> <strong>Affordability.</strong> Improve and maintain the
transportation system to increase access to convenient and affordable
transportation options for all Portlanders, especially those who have
traditionally been under-served or under-represented or have
historically borne unequal burdens.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.9 Accessible and age-friendly transportation system.</strong> Ensure
that transportation facilities are accessible to people of all ages and
abilities, and that all improvements to the transportation system
(traffic, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian) in the public right-of-way
comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Improve and
adapt the transportation system to better meet the needs of the most
vulnerable users, including the young, older adults, and people with
different abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.10</strong> <strong>Geographic policies.</strong> Adopt geographically-specific
policies in the Transportation System Plan to ensure that transportation
infrastructure reflects the unique topography, historic character,
natural features, system gaps, economic needs, demographics, and land
uses of each area. Use the Pattern Areas identified in Chapter 3: Urban
Form as the basis for area policies.</p>
<h2 id="land-use-development-and-placemaking">Land use, development, and placemaking</h2>
<p>Land use patterns and connections among different land uses are key
elements defining the form and character of places. In tandem with
Chapter 3: Urban Form and Chapter 4: Design and Development, the
policies in this section give direction for designing and building a
transportation system that supports, complements, and meets the needs of
different places. These policies acknowledge development adjacent to
transportation as a critical component in shaping the future of
Portland’s public spaces and places.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.11 Land use and transportation coordination.</strong> Implement the
Comprehensive Plan Map and the Urban Design Framework though coordinated
long-range transportation and land use planning. Ensure that street
policy and design classifications and land uses complement one another.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.12 Growth strategy.</strong> Use street design and policy
classifications to support Goals 3A-3G in Chapter 3: Urban Form.
Consider the different design contexts and transportation functions in
Town Centers, Neighborhood Centers, Neighborhood Corridors, Employment
Areas, Freight Corridors, Civic Corridors, Transit Station Areas, and
Greenways.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.13 Development and street design.</strong> Evaluate adjacent land
uses to help inform street classifications in framing, shaping, and
activating the public space of streets. Guide development and land use
to create the kinds of places and street environments intended for
different types of streets.</p>
<p><strong>Streets as public spaces</strong></p>
<p>Streets, including sidewalks and planting strips, provide critical
transportation and utility functions. In Portland, streets are the most
abundant type of public space, occupying nearly 20 percent of land area
in the city. The following policies support community desire to expand
the use of streets beyond their transportation functions. <em>See Chapter
8: Public Facilities and Services and Chapter 4: Design and Development
for further use and streetscape policies.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.14 Streets for transportation and public spaces.</strong> Integrate
both placemaking and transportation functions when designing and
managing streets by encouraging design, development, and operation of
streets to enhance opportunities for them to serve as places for
community interaction, environmental function, open space, tree canopy,
recreation, and other community purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.15 Repurposing street space.</strong> Encourage repurposing street
segments that are not critical for transportation connectivity to other
community purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.16 Design with nature.</strong> Promote street and trail alignments
and designs that respond to topography and natural features, when
feasible, and protect streams, wildlife habitat, and native trees.</p>
<p><strong>Modal policies</strong></p>
<p>Portland is committed to providing a multimodal transportation system
that offers affordable and convenient travel options within the city,
region, and outside the Metro area. Because trips are made for different
reasons, they vary in length and type of vehicle (mode) needed to make
them. Different modes create different kinds of impacts — on
neighborhood livability and carbon emissions, for example. These
policies recognize that some modes are more appropriate than others for
different types of trips.</p>

expand high-quality frequent transit service to all Town Centers, Civic
Corridors, Neighborhood Centers, Neighborhood Corridors, and other major
concentrations of employment, and improve service to areas with high
concentrations of poverty and historically under-served and
under-represented communities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.26 Transit funding.</strong> Consider funding strategies and
partnership opportunities that improve access to and equity in transit
service, such as raising metro-wide funding to improve service and
decrease user fees/fares.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.27 Transit service to centers and corridors.</strong> Use transit
investments as a means to shape the city’s growth and increase transit
use. In partnership with TriMet and Metro**,** maintain, expand, and

that the transportation system supports traded sector economic
development plans and full utilization of prime industrial land,
including brownfield redevelopment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.32 Multimodal system and hub.</strong> Maintain Portland’s role as a
multimodal hub for global and regional movement of goods. Enhance
Portland’s network of multimodal freight corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.33 Freight network.</strong> Develop, manage, and maintain a safe,
efficient, and reliable freight street network to provide freight access
to and from intermodal freight facilities, industrial and commercial
districts, and the regional transportation system. Invest to accommodate
forecasted growth of interregional freight volumes and provide access to
truck, marine, rail, and air transportation systems. Ensure designated
routes and facilities are adequate for over-dimensional trucks and
emergency equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.34 Sustainable freight system.</strong> Support the efficient
delivery of goods and services to businesses and neighborhoods, while
also reducing environmental and neighborhood impacts. Encourage the use
of energy efficient and clean delivery vehicles, and manage on- and
off-street loading spaces to ensure adequate access for deliveries to
businesses, while maintaining access to homes and businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.35 Freight rail network.</strong> Coordinate with stakeholders and
regional partners to support continued reinvestment in, and

<p><strong>Policy 9.50 Regional congestion management</strong>. Coordinate with Metro to
establish new regional multimodal mobility standards that prioritize
transit, freight, and system completeness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>9.50.a.</strong> Create a regional congestion management approach,
including a market-based system, to price or charge for auto trips and
parking, better account for the cost of auto trips, and to more
efficiently manage the regional system.</p>
<p><strong>9.50.b.</strong> In the interim, use the deficiency thresholds and
operating standards of the Regional Mobility Policy, in Figure 9‐4,
for evaluation of impacts to state facilities and the regional
arterial and throughway network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Policy 9.51</strong> <strong>Multimodal Mixed-Use Area.</strong> Designate a Central City
Multimodal Mixed-Use Area (MMA) in the geography indicated in Figure
9‐2, which will render state congestion / mobility standards
inapplicable to proposed plan amendments under OAR 660-0012-0060(10),
subject to ODOT concurrence and execution of an agreement between ODOT
and the City of Portland. The agreement should emphasize potential
safety and operational impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation Demand Management</strong></p>
<p>Providing residents and employees information and incentives to walk,
bicycle, use transit, and otherwise reduce the need to own and use
private vehicles can be one of the quickest, least expensive, and most
effective strategies to achieve City goals and to prevent traffic and
parking impacts. Transportation and parking demand management (TDM)
programs can cost-effectively increase the modal share of walking,
bicycling, and shared vehicle trips.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.52 Outreach</strong>. Create and maintain TDM outreach programs that
work with Transportation Management Associations (TMA), residents,
employers, and employees that increase the modal share of walking,
bicycling, and shared vehicle trips while reducing private vehicle
ownership, parking demand, and drive-alone trips, especially during peak
periods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.53 New development</strong>. Create and maintain TDM regulations and
services that prevent and reduce traffic and parking impacts from new
development and redevelopment. Encourage coordinated area-wide delivery
of TDM programs. Monitor and improve the performance of private-sector
TDM programs.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.54 Projects and programs.</strong> Integrate TDM information into
transportation project and program development and implementation to
increase use of new multimodal transportation projects and services.</p>
<p>**Parking management<br>
**Vibrant urban places link people and activities. As Portland grows, we
must manage both the demand and supply of parking to achieve climate,
health, livability, and prosperity goals. Providing too much and/or
underpriced parking can lead to more driving and less walking, cycling,
and transit use; inefficient land use patterns; and sprawl. Insufficient
parking can negatively affect neighborhood livability and economic
vitality. These policies provide guidance to manage parking demand and
supply to meet a variety of public objectives, including achieving
compact walkable communities, reducing private vehicle ownership and
overall vehicle use, enhancing livability, reducing pollution, and
expanding<br>
economic opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.55 Parking management.</strong> Reduce parking demand and manage
supply to improve pedestrian, bicycle and transit mode share,
neighborhood livability, safety, business district vitality, vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) reduction, and air quality. Implement strategies
that reduce demand for new parking and private vehicle ownership, and
that help maintain optimal parking occupancy and availability.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.56 Curb Zone.</strong> Recognize that the Curb Zone is a public
space, a physical and spatial asset that has value and cost. Evaluate
whether, when, and where parking is the highest and best use of this
public space in support of broad City policy goals and local land use
context. Establish thresholds to utilize parking management and pricing
tools in areas with high parking demand to ensure adequate on-street
parking supply during peak periods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.57 On-street parking.</strong> Manage parking and loading demand,
supply, and operations in the public right of way to achieve mode share
objectives, and to encourage safety, economic vitality, and livability.
Use transportation demand management and pricing of parking in areas
with high parking demand.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.58 Off-street parking.</strong> Limit the development of new parking
spaces to achieve land use, transportation, and environmental goals,
especially in locations with frequent transit service. Regulate
off-street parking to achieve mode share objectives, promote compact and
walkable urban form, encourage lower rates of car ownership, and promote
the vitality of commercial and employment areas. Use transportation
demand management and pricing of parking in areas with high parking
demand. Strive to provide adequate but not excessive off-street parking
where needed, consistent with the<br>
preceding practices.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.59 Share space and resources.</strong> Encourage the shared use of
parking and vehicles to maximize the efficient use of limited urban
space.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9</strong>.<strong>60</strong> <strong>Cost and price.</strong> Recognize the high public and
private cost of parking by encouraging prices that reflect the cost of
providing parking and balance demand and supply. Discourage employee and
resident parking subsidies.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.61 Bicycle parking.</strong> Promote the development of new bicycle
parking facilities including dedicated bike parking in the public
right-of-way. Provide sufficient bicycle parking at high-capacity
transit stations to enhance bicycle connection opportunities. Require
provision of adequate off-street bicycle parking for new development and
redevelopment. Encourage the provision of parking for different types of
bicycles. In establishing the standards for long-term bicycle parking,
consider the needs of persons with different levels of ability.</p>
<p>**Finance, programs, and coordination<br>
**Programs and funding are required to build and maintain the
transportation system, and they are necessary to help decide what
projects to build. They also provide public information about what
facilities are available and how they can be used. Agencies outside the
City also own and operate facilities within Portland and provide funding
for new facilities. These policies address essential funding and
coordination opportunities with other agencies, as well outreach and
education programming.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.62</strong> <strong>Coordination</strong>. Coordinate with state and federal
agencies, local and regional governments, special districts, other City
bureaus, and providers of transportation services when planning for,
developing, and funding transportation facilities and services.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.63</strong> <strong>New development impacts.</strong> Prevent, reduce, and
mitigate the impacts of new development and redevelopment on the
transportation system. Utilize strategies including transportation and
parking demand management, transportation system analysis, and system
and local impact mitigation improvements and fees.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.64 Education and encouragement.</strong> Create, maintain, and
coordinate educational and encouragement programs that support
multimodal transportation and that emphasize safety for all modes of
transportation. Ensure that these programs are accessible to
historically under-served and under-represented populations.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.65 Telecommuting.</strong> Promote telecommuting and the use of
communications technology to reduce travel demand.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.66</strong> <strong>Project and program selection criteria.</strong> Establish
transportation project and program selection criteria consistent with
goals 9A through 9I, to cost-effectively achieve access, placemaking,
sustainability, equity, health, prosperity, and safety goals.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.67</strong> <strong>Funding.</strong> Encourage the development of a range of
stable transportation funding sources that provide adequate resources to
build and maintain an equitable and sustainable transportation system.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 8: Public Facilities and Services</strong></p>
<p>**Funding<br>
**Portland’s investments in the public facility systems necessary to
serve designated land uses are funded through a variety of mechanisms,
including taxes, user rates and fees, system development charges, and
partnerships. The policies in this section acknowledge and support
cost-effective service provision, maintenance of diverse funding streams
to support the public’s investments, and equitable sharing of the costs
of investing in and maintaining the City’s public facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.27 Cost-effectiveness</strong>. Establish, improve, and maintain the
public facilities necessary to serve designated land uses in ways that
cost-effectively provide desired levels of service, consider facilities’

<p><strong>Policy 8.28 Shared costs</strong>. Ensure the costs of constructing and
providing public facilities and services are equitably shared by those
who benefit from the provision of those facilities and services.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.29 System development</strong>. Require private or public entities
whose prospective development or redevelopment actions contribute to the
need for public facility improvements, extensions, or construction to
bear a proportional share of the costs.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.30</strong> <strong>Partnerships.</strong> Maintain or establish public and
private partnerships for the development, management, or stewardship of
public facilities necessary to serve designated land uses, as
appropriate.</p>
<p>**Public benefits<br>
**The following policies support investments to improve equity, economic
prosperity, human and watershed health, and resiliency while minimizing
negative impacts. They also recognize that the public facility and
service needs, and the appropriate approaches to meeting those needs,
vary throughout the city. <em>See Chapter 2: Community Involvement</em> for
policies related to community engagement in public facility decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Policy 8.36 Context-sensitive infrastructure</strong>. Design, improve, and
maintain public rights-of-way and facilities in ways that are compatible
with, and that minimize negative impacts on, their physical,
environmental, and community context.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.37 Site- and area-specific needs.</strong> Allow for site- and
area-specific public facility standards, requirements, tools, and
policies as needed to address distinct topographical, geologic,
environmental, and other conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.38 Age-friendly public facilities.</strong> Promote public facility
designs that make Portland more age-friendly.</p>
<p>**Public rights-of-way<br>
**The policies in this section support the role of public rights-of-way
in providing multiple public services, including multimodal
transportation access and movement, stormwater management, water
distribution, private utilities, tree canopy, and community use, among
others. Current practices and the Portland Plan regard public
rights-of-way as a coordinated and interconnected network that provides
a place for these multiple public facilities and functions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.39 Interconnected network</strong>. Establish a safe and connected
rights-of-way system that equitably provides infrastructure services
throughout the city.</p>

rights-of-way to support City canopy goals, transportation functions,
and economic, social, and environmental objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.44 Community uses</strong>. Allow community use of rights-of-way for
purposes such as public gathering space, events, food production, or
temporary festivals, as long as the community uses are integrated in
ways that balance and minimize conflict with the designated through
movement and access roles of rights-of-ways.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.45 Pedestrian amenities.</strong> Encourage facilities that enhance
pedestrian enjoyment, such as transit shelters, garbage containers,
benches, etc. in the right of way.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.46 Commercial uses</strong>. Accommodate allowable commercial uses
of the rights-of-way for the purpose of enhancing commercial vitality,
if the commercial uses can be integrated in ways that balance and
minimize conflict with the other functions of the right-of-way. Restrict
the size of signage in the right-of-way.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.47 Flexible design</strong>. Allow flexibility in right-of-way
design and development standards to appropriately reflect the pattern
area and other relevant physical, community, and environmental contexts
and local needs.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.48 Corridors and City Greenways</strong>. Ensure public facilities
located along Civic Corridors, Neighborhood Corridors, and City
Greenways support the multiple objectives established for these
corridors. *Corridor and City Greenway goals and policies are listed in
Chapter 3: Urban Form. *</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.49 Coordination</strong>. Coordinate the planning, design,
development, improvement, and maintenance of public rights-of-way among
appropriate public agencies, private providers, and adjacent landowners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>8.49.a.</strong> Coordination efforts should include the public facilities

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Policy 8.50 Undergrounding</strong>. Encourage undergrounding of electrical
and telecommunications facilities within public rights-of-way,
especially in centers and along Civic Corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.51 Right-of-way vacations</strong>. Maintain rights-of-way if there
is an established existing or future need for them, such as for
transportation facilities or for other public functions established in
policies 8.40 to 8.46.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.52 Rail rights-of-way.</strong> Preserve existing and abandoned rail
rights-of-way for future rail or public trail uses.</p>
<p>**Trails<br>
**The City of Portland’s trail system is a key part of both the City’s
multi-modal transportation system and its recreation system. Trails
within this system take many different forms and are located within the
right-of-way and on public and private property. Trails provide
Portlanders with local and regional pedestrian and bicycle connections
and access to many key destinations within the city. They also provide a
place to recreate and allow Portlanders to experience the city’s parks
and natural areas. Trails play a particularly important role in meeting
pedestrian and bicyclist mobility and connectivity needs in western
neighborhoods. <em>See Western Neighborhood Pattern Area Policies 3.100 and
3.103</em>. The policies in this section support continued improvement,
management, and coordination of the trail system.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.53 Public trails.</strong> Establish, improve, and maintain a
citywide system of local and regional public trails that provide
transportation and/or recreation options and are a component of larger
network of facilities for bicyclists, pedestrians, and recreational
users.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.54 Trail system connectivity.</strong> Plan, improve, and maintain
the citywide trail system so that it connects and improves access to
Portland’s neighborhoods, commercial areas, employment centers, schools,
parks, natural areas, recreational facilities, regional destinations,
the regional trail system, and other key places that Portlanders access
in their daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.55 Trail coordination</strong>. Coordinate planning, design,
improvement, and maintenance of the trail system among City agencies,
other public agencies, non-governmental partners, and adjacent
landowners.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.56 Trail diversity.</strong> Allow a variety of trail types to
reflect a trail’s transportation and recreation roles, requirements, and
physical context.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.57 Public access requirements</strong>. Require public access and
improvement of Major Public Trails as shown in Figure 8-2 — Major Public
Trails. Major Public Trails include regional trails and other
significant trail connections that provide for the movement of
pedestrians, cyclists, and other users for recreation and transportation
purposes**. **</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.58 Trail and City Greenway coordination.</strong> Coordinate the
planning and improvement of trails as part of the City Greenways system.
<em>See Chapter 3: Urban Form for additional policies related to City
Greenways.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.59 Trail and Habitat Corridor coordination.</strong> Coordinate the
planning and improvement of trails with the establishment, enhancement,
preservation, and access to habitat corridors. <em>See Chapter 3: Urban
Form for additional policies related to Habitat Corridors.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.60 Intertwine coordination.</strong> Coordinate with the Intertwine
Alliance and its partners, including local and regional parks providers,
to integrate Portland’s trail and active transportation network with the

The City’s sewer and drainage system accommodates Portland’s current and future needs. It also protects public health, water quality, and the environment. Using asset management and watershed health as goals and guides, the City considers the whole watershed as an interconnected hydrologic system.</h2>
<p>The City manages sanitary sewage through an extensive piped collection
and treatment system, including two wastewater treatment plants that
discharge to the Columbia and Willamette rivers. Stormwater is managed
and conveyed through a variety of facilities, including pipes, sumps,
surface facilities, and natural drainageways. Green infrastructure,
including landscaped stormwater facilities and natural resources such as
trees and natural areas, is an important part of the stormwater system.
Private property investments and public-private partnerships also play
key roles in the management of stormwater.</p>
<p>The policies below ensure effective sanitary and stormwater systems.</p>
<p><strong>Stormwater system</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.68 Stormwater facilities</strong>. Provide adequate stormwater
facilities for conveyance, flow control, and pollution reduction.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.71 Green infrastructure</strong>. Promote the use of green
infrastructure, such as natural areas, the urban forest, and landscaped
stormwater facilities, to manage stormwater.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.72 Stormwater discharge.</strong> Avoid or minimize the impact of
stormwater discharges on the water and habitat quality of rivers and
streams.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.73 On-site stormwater management</strong>. Encourage on-site
stormwater management, or management as close to the source as
practical, through land use decisions and public facility investments.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Urban Form</p>
<p><strong>Citywide Design and Development</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.4 All ages and abilities.</strong> Strive for a built environment
that provides a safe, healthful, and attractive environment for people
of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Centers</strong></p>
<p>Centers are compact and pedestrian-oriented urban places. They are
connected to public transit and active transportation networks. They
anchor complete neighborhoods with retail stores and businesses (grocery
stores, restaurants, markets, shops, etc.), civic amenities (libraries,
schools, community centers, places of worship, etc.), housing options,
health clinics, daycare centers, employment centers, plazas and parks,
or other public gathering places.</p>
<p>Centers will be the primary areas for growth and change in Portland over
the next 20 years. Focusing new growth in centers helps achieve goals of
having more Portlanders live in complete neighborhoods, use public
transit and active transportation — walking, biking, and rolling — to
commute to work and complete errands, and it will help mitigate and
prepare for the effects of climate change. Clustering destinations and
housing within compact, walkable centers makes access by transit,
walking, wheelchair, and bicycle more practical and reduces the amount
of driving needed to access services, reducing the impact on roadways,
reducing congestion, and helps in facilitating freight movement.</p>
<p>Centers range in scale from the Central City’s downtown to small
neighborhood centers, providing local access to services and allowing
Portlanders across the city to live a healthy, active lifestyle.
Neighborhood business districts and the commercial services they provide
are the foundation of many centers, but centers, particularly larger
centers, will also become a focus for public services, gathering places,
and housing growth. In and around all centers, there will be change as
areas urbanize and new services, shops and housing<br>
are developed.</p>
<p>The UDF identifies four types of centers that vary in size, scale,
service area, local versus regional role, and density of residents and
businesses. The specific boundaries of these centers is shown on the
Comprehensive Plan Map.</p>
<p>The four types are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Central City</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regional Center (Gateway)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Town Center</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Center</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Policies in this section identify essential elements and functions of
centers that will be enhanced over time. Additional policies provide
more detailed direction for specific types of centers based on their
scale.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.16 Investments in centers.</strong> Encourage public and private
investment in infrastructure, economic development, and community
services in centers to ensure that all centers will support the
populations they serve.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.19 Accessibility.</strong> Design centers to be compact, safe,
attractive, and accessible places, where the street environment makes
access by transit, walking, biking, and mobility devices such as
wheelchairs, safe and attractive for people of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.20 Center connections.</strong> Connect centers to each other and to
other key local and regional destinations, such as schools, parks, and
employment areas, by pedestrian trails and sidewalks, bicycle sharing,
bicycle routes, frequent and convenient transit, and electric vehicle
charging stations. Prepare and adopt future street plans for centers
that currently have poor street connectivity, especially where large
commercial parcels are planned to receive significant additional housing
density.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.21 Green infrastructure in centers.</strong> Integrate nature and
green infrastructure into centers and enhance public views and
connections to the surrounding natural features.</p>
<p>*<em>Central City</em><br>
***The Central City is a living laboratory for how the design and
function of a dense urban center can concurrently provide benefits to
human health, the natural environment, and the local economy. As
Portland is the major center for jobs, transit, services, and civic and
cultural institutions for the entire city and region. The Central City
houses numerous attractions including Portland State University, the
Oregon Convention Center, City Hall, Tom McCall Waterfront Park and the
Willamette River, Pioneer Courthouse Square, and many museums and venues
for artistic and cultural activities and professional sports. The
Central City’s ten unique districts include Downtown, the West End,
Goose Hollow, Pearl, Old Town/Chinatown, Lower Albina, Lloyd, the
Central Eastside, South Waterfront, and South Downtown/University.
Together, these districts provide a diversity of opportunities for urban
living, economic development, retail and entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.26 Transportation hub.</strong> Enhance the Central City as the
region’s multimodal transportation hub and optimize regional access as
well as the movement of people and goods among key destinations.</p>
<p>**Gateway Regional Center<br>
**Gateway Regional Center is East Portland’s major center, providing the
area and region with civic, employment, and community services. It
includes the city’s largest transit hub outside of downtown and good
freeway access to regional destinations such as Portland International
Airport.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.30 Transportation.</strong> Enhance Gateway’s role as a regional
high-capacity transit hub that serves<br>
as an anchor for East Portland’s multimodal transportation system.</p>
<p>**Town Centers<br>
**Town Centers are located throughout Portland to serve broad parts of
the city. They are typically anchored by employment centers or
institutions, feature a wide range of commercial and community services,
and have a wide range of housing options. Development in Town Centers is
intended to be up to mid-rise in scale, with larger scale buildings
primarily located close to high-capacity transit stations. Mid-rise
development is typically as high as five to seven stories.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.34 Transportation.</strong> Improve Town Centers as multimodal
transportation hubs that optimize access from the broad area of the city
they serve and are linked to the region’s high-capacity transit system.</p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Centers</strong></p>
<p>Neighborhood Centers are smaller, sometimes village-like centers that
include a mixture of higher density commercial and residential
buildings. Because these centers are smaller than Town Centers, there
are many more of them citywide. Development in Neighborhood Centers is
generally intended to be low-rise in scale, although larger scale can be
appropriate in locations close to high-capacity transit stations or near
the Central City. Low-rise development typically includes buildings up
to four stories in height.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.38 Transportation.</strong> Design Neighborhood Centers as
multimodal transportation hubs that are served by frequent-service
transit and optimize pedestrian and bicycle access from adjacent
neighborhoods.</p>
<p>**Inner Ring Districts **</p>
<p>The Inner Ring Districts include some of Portland’s oldest
neighborhoods, with several historic districts and a broad diversity of
housing types. These areas include distinct districts, such as Albina
and Northwest Portland, that have multiple mixed-use corridors in
proximity (<em>see the shaded areas in the Urban Design Framework</em>),
allowing most residents to live within a quarter-mile distance of
frequent-service transit and neighborhood businesses. The Inner Ring
Districts are also served by a highly interconnected system of streets
and sidewalks, and are within a three-mile biking distance of the
Central City’s array of services, jobs, and amenities.</p>
<p>These policies acknowledge that growth in the Inner Ring Districts plays
an important role in allowing more people to have access to their many
opportunities, but also acknowledge that this growth should be
integrated into these areas’ historic urban fabric. The Inner Ring
Districts, especially along their corridors, play a similar role to Town
Centers in accommodating growth.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3</strong>.<strong>41</strong> <strong>Corridors.</strong> Guide growth in corridors to
transition to mid-rise scale close to the Central City, especially along
Civic Corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3</strong>.<strong>44 Active transportation.</strong> Enhance the role of the Inner
Ring Districts’ extensive transit, bicycle, and pedestrian networks in
conjunction with land uses that optimize the ability for more people to
utilize this network. Improve the safety of pedestrian and bike
connections to the Central City. Strengthen transit connections between
the Inner Ring Districts and to the Central City.</p>
<p>**Corridors<br>
**Corridors, like centers, are areas where Portland will grow and change
much over the next 20 years. They are busy, active streets with
redevelopment potential. They are close to neighborhoods and are places
with transit, stores, housing, and employers. They need to be planned,
designed, and improved to be places that benefit and become successful
additions to surrounding neighborhoods. The largest places of focused
activity and density along these corridors are designated as centers.</p>
<p>There are two types of street corridors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Civic Corridors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Corridors</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Policy 3.45 Growth and mobility.</strong> Coordinate transportation and land
use strategies along corridors to accommodate growth and mobility needs
for people of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.46 Connections.</strong> Improve corridors as multimodal connections
providing transit, pedestrian, bicycle, and motor vehicle access and
that serve the freight needs of centers and neighborhood business
districts.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.47 Design.</strong> Encourage street design that balances the
important transportation functions of corridors with their roles as the
setting for commercial activity and residential living.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.48 Green infrastructure in corridors.</strong> Enhance corridors
with distinctive green infrastructure, including landscaped stormwater
facilities, extensive tree plantings, and other landscaping that both
provide environmental function and contribute to a quality pedestrian
environment.</p>
<p>**Civic Corridors<br>
**Civic Corridors are the city’s busiest, widest, and most prominent
streets. They provide major connections among centers, the rest of the
City, and the region. They support the movement of people and goods
across the city, with high levels of traffic and pedestrian activity.
Civic Corridors provide opportunities for growth and transit-supportive
densities of housing, commerce, and employment. Development in Civic
Corridors is intended to be up to mid-rise in scale, with lower scale
generally more appropriate in locations far from the Central City or
transit stations. Mid-rise development typically ranges from five to
seven stories.</p>
<p>Abundant trees and high-quality landscaping beautify Civic Corridors and
offset the impacts of their large paved areas. These corridors exemplify
the benefits of green infrastructure by cleaning and soaking up
stormwater runoff and minimizing urban heat island effects, while also
being enjoyable places to live, work, and gather. Civic corridors are
safe for all types of transportation. Civic Corridors policies apply to
the roadway, the public realm of the street, and the buildings that line
the street.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.49 Integrated land use and mobility.</strong> Enhance Civic
Corridors as distinctive places that are models of ecological urban
design, with transit-supportive densities of housing and employment,
prominent street trees and other green features, and high-quality
transit service and pedestrian and<br>
bicycle facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.50 Design great places.</strong> Improve public streets and
sidewalks along Civic Corridors to support the vitality of business
districts, create distinctive places, provide a safe, healthy, and
attractive pedestrian environment, and contribute to quality living
environments for residents.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.51 Mobility corridors.</strong> Improve Civic Corridors as key
mobility corridors of citywide importance that accommodate all modes of
transportation within their right-of-way or on nearby parallel routes.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.52 Freight.</strong> Maintain freight mobility and access on Civic
Corridors that are also Major or Priority Truck Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Corridors</strong></p>
<p>Neighborhood Corridors are narrower main streets that connect
neighborhoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They have
transportation, land use, and design functions that are important at a
neighborhood or district level. They support neighborhood business
districts and provide housing opportunities close to local services,
amenities, and transit lines. They are streets that include a mix of
commercial and higher-density housing development. This policy is
intended to balance the important transportation functions of
Neighborhood Corridors with their roles in supporting the viability of
business districts and residential livability.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.53 Neighborhood Corridors.</strong> Enhance Neighborhood Corridors
as important places that support vibrant neighborhood business districts
with quality multi-family housing, while providing transportation
connections that link neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Transit station areas</strong></p>
<p>Transit stations provide access to high-capacity transit, which
currently consists of the region’s light rail system, and in the future
may also include bus rapid transit. These policies encourage housing and
employment growth in transit station areas to maximize people’s ability
to benefit from the regional connections they provide and to increase
transit access to employment. The policies support a range of transit
station area types, with differing priorities for growth, depending on
the station type and context.</p>
<p>Priority is given to growth in station areas located in centers since
they provide more people with opportunities to be close to both transit
and to commercial and public services. These stations have the highest
potential for mixed use development. Center stations benefit from the
concentration of local services and businesses as well as connections to
other transit routes typically found on corridors. Mixed-use development
with housing is not the priority for all transit station areas; some are
locations for employment, or they serve major regional destinations such
as the Oregon Zoo. <em>See Figure 3-4 — Transit Station Areas.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.54 Transit-oriented development.</strong> Encourage transit-oriented
development and transit-supportive concentrations of housing and jobs,
and multimodal connections at and adjacent to high-capacity transit
stations.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.55 Community connections.</strong> Integrate transit stations into
surrounding communities and enhance pedestrian and bicycle facilities
(including bike sharing) to provide safe and accessible connections to
key destinations beyond the station area.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.56 Transit station area safety.</strong> Design transit areas to
improve pedestrian, bicycle, and personal safety.</p>
<p><strong>City Greenways</strong></p>
<p>City Greenways are a system of distinctive pedestrian- and
bicycle-friendly streets and trails, enhanced by lush tree canopy and
landscaped stormwater facilities that support active living by expanding
transportation and recreational opportunities and making it easier and
more attractive to reach destinations across the city. As Portland
continues to grow, the City Greenways system will strengthen connections
to nature, weave green elements into neighborhoods, and enhance mobility
and recreation.</p>
<p>City Greenways are a network that includes the following types of
infrastructure:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enhanced greenway corridors are distinctive streets with extensive
tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that provide
connections between major centers, schools, parks, natural areas,
and the rivers. Enhanced greenway corridors often involve
improvements to existing streets, including wide planting strips and
other features that provide space for large-canopy trees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trails are designated routes on land or water that provide public
access for recreation or transportation purposes, such as walking
and bicycling. They are often located along rivers, through natural
areas, or along rail or highway rights-of-way, with connections to
and through neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heritage parkways are iconic streets or segments of streets with
elements such as linear parkways, scenic views, and distinctive
landscaping or street design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood greenways are an extensive network of streets with low
volumes of motor vehicle traffic that are prioritized for bicycles
and enhance the pedestrian environment, working in conjunction with
the rest of the City Greenways system to extend the system into
all neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>See Figure 3-5 – City Greenways.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.61 Connections.</strong> Create a network of distinctive and
attractive City Greenways that link centers, parks, schools, rivers,
natural areas, and other key community destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.62 Integrated system.</strong> Create an integrated City Greenways
system that includes regional trails through natural areas and along
Portland’s rivers, connected to neighborhood greenways, and heritage
parkways.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.63 Multiple benefits.</strong> Design City Greenways that provide
multiple benefits that contribute to Portland’s pedestrian, bicycle,
green infrastructure, and parks and open space systems.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.64 Design.</strong> Use design options such as distinctive street
design, motor vehicle diversion, landscaping, tree plantings, scenic
views, and other appropriate design options, to create City Greenways
that extend the experience of open spaces and nature into neighborhoods,
while improving stormwater management and calming traffic.</p>
<p><em>Additional policies related to City Greenways are provided in Chapter
9: Transportation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Employment areas</strong></p>
<p>Portland is a major employment center in the region and the state. The
diversity of the economy is spread evenly among four types of business
sectors that thrive in different parts of the city: industrial, office,
institutional, and retail/service. The city’s employment geographies
are:</p>
<p><strong>Central City:</strong> The Central City is the region’s high-density
employment center. It is primarily an office district for professional
and business services, finance, information, software, and government.
It is also a key location for the entertainment, small industry, and<br>
education sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Districts:</strong> Industrial districts are in the low, flat
areas along Portland Harbor and the Columbia Corridor, Oregon’s freight
infrastructure hub. Manufacturing and distribution sectors concentrate
here. They typically need one-story buildings, medium to large sites,
and locations buffered from housing. There is also an industrial
district in the Central Eastside and smaller industrial areas scattered
around the city, mostly adjacent to major transportation hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Commercial</strong>: Neighborhood Commercial areas are mainly
home to the retail, personal service, and related sectors that serve
customers on-site. These businesses locate amid their market areas,
lining corridors across the city. They generally need ground-floor space
along pedestrian or auto-oriented streets.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Institutions:</strong> Institutions in the health care and education
sectors are concentrated in large hospital and college campuses and
dispersed smaller facilities. Major institutions are large employers
with campuses that vary from pastoral expanses to more concentrated
urban grounds. They are located throughout the city, often in or
adjacent to<br>
residential areas.</p>
<p>Each of these sectors is growing, and each has different land use needs
and offers different prosperity benefits. Traded sector (export)
businesses bring income and jobs into the region and are mainly in the
industrial and office sectors. Middle-wage jobs that require less
college education and offer upward mobility are concentrated in the
industrial sectors. Office jobs offer a wide variety of wages and are
mainly concentrated in the Central City but are also distributed in
neighborhood business districts.</p>
<p>Retail and service sector jobs are concentrated in the Central City and
neighborhood business districts. They provide needed services to
residents and include many locally-owned businesses; they do not
typically offer higher-paying employment opportunities. The health care
and education sectors are the leading job growth opportunities, most of
which are located on major campuses. Healthcare is one of the city’s
fastest growing<br>
employment sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Truck Corridors:</strong> Maintaining the primary truck routes into
and through the city supports Portland’s role as an important West Coast
hub and a gateway for international and domestic trade. These streets
are integral to the growth of traded sector businesses such as
manufacturing, warehousing and distribution industries.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3</strong>.<strong>69</strong> <strong>Regional Truck Corridors.</strong> Enhance designated
streets to accommodate forecast freight growth and support intensified
industrial use in nearby freight districts. <em>See Figure 3-7 — Employment
Areas.</em> Designated regional truckways and priority truck streets
(Transportation System Plan classifications are shown to illustrate this
network).</p>
<p>**Pattern Areas<br>
**Portland has five distinct Pattern Areas. The development patterns and
characteristics of these areas are influenced by the natural landscape
and how and when these parts of the city were developed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rivers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Central City</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inner Neighborhoods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Western Neighborhoods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eastern Neighborhoods</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each Pattern Area has unique physical, social, cultural, and
environmental qualities that differentiate them and create their sense
of place. To maintain and enhance the positive qualities and sense of
place in each pattern area, it is desirable to have policies and
regulations that respond to each area’s unique natural and built assets.</p>
<p>The following policies identify key positive characteristics of each of
Portland’s Pattern Areas that are relevant to decisions related to
future development in these areas. Area and neighborhood plans should be
consulted for more detailed guidance on design priorities in different
parts of the city.</p>
<p>**Rivers Pattern Area<br>
**Human settlement began along and at the confluence of the Willamette
and Columbia rivers because it offered Native Americans plentiful food,
natural resources, and critically-important trade and transportation
opportunities. After white immigrants began moving to the area, the
settlement grew into the city of Portland. As the city’s initial
form-giving features, the two rivers have continued to shape the city.</p>
<p>Today, the Willamette and Columbia rivers continue to serve multiple
functions and roles.</p>
<p>The rivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are features of significant historic and cultural significance to
Native American tribes and others throughout the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as essential industrial transportation corridors that support
the local and regional economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support recreational, subsistence, and commercial fisheries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide important habitat for resident and migratory fish
and wildlife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are important scenic, recreational, and transportation amenities for
Portlanders<br>
and visitors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These policies foster development and land stewardship approaches that
recognize, support, and balance the varied systems, uses, and activities
along the Columbia and Willamette rivers, including: the Portland
Harbor, Columbia Corridor, and other prime industrial lands; habitat
areas and corridors; distinctive riverfront neighborhoods along the
banks; and access to, along, and within the rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.71 River transportation.</strong> Recognize and enhance the roles of
the Willamette and Columbia rivers as part of Portland’s historic,
current, and future transportation infrastructure, including for
freight, commerce, commuting, and other public and private
transportation functions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.73 Industry and port facilities.</strong> Enhance the regionally
significant economic infrastructure that includes Oregon’s largest
seaport and largest airport, unique multimodal freight, rail, and harbor
access; the region’s critical energy hub; and proximity to anchor
manufacturing and<br>
distribution facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.77 River access.</strong> Enhance and complete Portland’s system of
river access points and riverside trails, including the Willamette
Greenway Trail, and strengthen active transportation connections between
neighborhoods and the rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.83 Willamette River Greenway.</strong> Maintain multi-objective
plans and regulations to guide development, infrastructure investments,
and natural resource protection and enhancement within and along the
Willamette Greenway.</p>
<p>**Central City Pattern Area<br>
**The Central City is home to Portland’s greatest concentrations of
employment, and civic, cultural, and higher education institutions.
Primary natural features include the Willamette River, large street
trees, green streets and landscaping, and corridors of park blocks that
further weave nature into the Central City. The area’s high-density
mixed-use neighborhoods contribute to the distinct identities of
different areas within the Central City. These policies highlight some
key design priorities for the Central City related to its distinctive
urban form. These policies encourage design in the Central City that
enhances its role as the region’s center of innovation and exchange, in
recognition that a healthy city must have a healthy core.</p>
<p><em>Additional policies related to the design of the Central City are
provided in the Centers section of this chapter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.86 Central City pedestrian system.</strong> Maintain and expand the
Central City’s highly interconnected pedestrian system.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.87</strong> <strong>Central City bicycle system.</strong> Expand and improve the
Central City’s bicycle system.</p>
<p>**Inner Neighborhoods Pattern Area<br>
**The Inner Neighborhoods were developed and shaped during the Streetcar
Era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Inner Neighborhoods
are characterized by a regular pattern of neighborhood business
districts located along former streetcar streets interspersed with
residential areas. This Pattern Area has a small block pattern with an
interconnected street grid that make transit, walking, and bicycling
attractive options. Within this Pattern Area is an inner ring of
neighborhoods that provide important opportunities for additional
housing close to the Central City, but where future growth should be
integrated into the existing and historic context. <em>See the Inner Ring
Districts section in this chapter</em>. These policies express the overall
design approach in Inner Neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.88 Inner Neighborhoods main streets.</strong> Maintain and enhance
the Streetcar Era pattern of street-oriented buildings along Civic and
Neighborhood corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.89 Inner Neighborhoods street patterns.</strong> Preserve the area’s
urban fabric of compact blocks and its highly interconnected grid of
streets.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.91 Inner Neighborhoods active transportation.</strong> Use the
extensive street, sidewalk, and bikeway system and multiple connections
to the Central City as a key part of Portland’s active transportation
system.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.92 Inner Neighborhoods residential areas.</strong> Continue the
patterns of small, connected blocks, regular lot patterns, and streets
lined by planting strips and street trees in Inner Neighborhood
residential areas.</p>
<p>**Eastern Neighborhoods Pattern Area<br>
**Portland’s Eastern Neighborhoods feature a diverse range of urban and
natural landscapes. Many structures in the Eastern Neighborhoods, which
also include parts of Brentwood-Darlington and Cully, were developed
after World War II. In addition, most of this this area was annexed into
the City of Portland after the 1980 Comprehensive Plan was completed.
The policies for the Eastern Neighborhoods promote design that responds
to and enhances the area’s distinctive mix of urban patterns and natural
features, such as groves of Douglas firs, the East Buttes, and streams.
Some policies address the opportunities and challenges presented by the
area’s large blocks, deep lots, gaps in pedestrian and bicycle
connectivity, and wide street corridors.</p>
<p>The Eastern Neighborhoods provide opportunities for new and distinctive
approaches to the design of development and infrastructure that can
enhance the area’s positive characteristics and improve quality of life.
It is important to continue the area’s verdant character and provide a
more livable environment, while reducing disparities and increasing
access to services.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.93 Eastern Neighborhoods street, block, and lot pattern.</strong>
Guide the evolving street and block system in the Eastern Neighborhoods
in ways that build on positive aspects of the area’s large blocks, such
as opportunities to continue mid-block open space patterns and create
new connections through blocks that make it easier to access community
destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.94 Eastern Neighborhoods site development.</strong> Require that
land be aggregated into larger sites before land divisions and other
redevelopment occurs. Require site plans which advance design and street
connectivity goals.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.95 Eastern Neighborhoods trees and natural features.</strong>
Encourage development and right-of-way design that preserves and
incorporates Douglas fir trees and groves, and that protects the area’s
streams, forests, wetlands, steep slopes, and buttes.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.97 Eastern Neighborhoods corridor landscaping.</strong> Encourage
landscaped building setbacks along residential corridors on major
streets.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.98 Eastern Neighborhoods active transportation.</strong> Enhance
access to centers, employment areas, and other community destinations in
Eastern Neighborhoods by ensuring that corridors have safe and
accessible pedestrian and bicycle facilities and creating additional
secondary connections that provide low-stress pedestrian and bicycle
access.</p>
<p>**Western Neighborhoods Pattern Area<br>
**The Western Neighborhoods have been shaped by their location within
the terrain of Portland’s west hills. Much of this area was developed
after World War II. These policies encourage design that responds to the
area’s prominent characteristics, such as its hilly topography, streams,
ravines, and forested slopes, while cultivating a built environment that
expands mobility and accessibility for all people. These design
approaches are intended to apply to a range of development types and
locations.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.100 Western Neighborhoods active transportation.</strong> Provide
safe and accessible pedestrian and bicycle connections, as well as
off-street trail connections, to and from residential neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.103 Western Neighborhoods trails.</strong> Develop
pedestrian-oriented connections and enhance the Western Neighborhoods’
distinctive system of trails to increase safety, expand mobility, access
to nature, and active living opportunities in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Design and Development Policies (Comp Plan Chapter 4)</strong></p>
<p>Portland’s neighborhoods have distinct characteristics and street
environments that provide a sense of place and that are a setting for
public life. The following policies guide building and site design to
respond to positive characteristics of their context and promote
accessible and attractive public environments. They also support
designing development to contribute to the quality of the public realm
of streets and other open spaces, and encourage the integration of
natural elements into the built environment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.1 Pattern areas.</strong> Encourage building and site designs that
respect the unique built natural, historic, and cultural characteristics
of Portland’s five pattern areas described in Chapter 3: Urban Form.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.2 Community identity.</strong> Encourage the development of
character-giving design features that are responsive to place and the
cultures of communities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.3 Site and context.</strong> Encourage development that responds to
and enhances the positive qualities of site and context — the
neighborhood, the block, the public realm, and natural features.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.4 Natural features and green infrastructure.</strong> Integrate
natural and green infrastructure such as trees, green spaces, ecoroofs,
gardens, green walls, and vegetated stormwater management systems, into
the urban environment. Encourage stormwater facilities that are designed
to be a functional and attractive element of public spaces, especially
in centers and corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.5 Pedestrian-oriented design.</strong> Enhance the pedestrian
experience throughout Portland through public and private development
that creates accessible, safe, and attractive places for all those who
walk and/or use wheelchairs or other mobility devices.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.6 Street orientation.</strong> Promote building and site designs
that enhance the pedestrian experience with windows, entrances,
pathways, and other features that provide connections to the street
environment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.7 Development and public spaces.</strong> Guide development to help
create high-quality public places and street environments while
considering the role of adjacent development in framing, shaping, and
activating the public space of streets and urban parks.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.8 Alleys.</strong> Encourage the continued use of alleys for parking
access, while preserving pedestrian access. Expand the number of
alley-facing accessory dwelling units.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.9 Transitional urbanism.</strong> Encourage temporary activities and
structures in places that are transitioning to urban areas to promote
job creation, entrepreneurship, active streets, and human interaction.</p>
<p>**Design and development of centers and corridors<br>
**Centers and corridors are places where large numbers of people live,
work, and visit. Careful attention to the design of centers and
corridors is necessary to ensure that they become places where people
want to live and gather, and where getting around by walking, biking, or
wheelchair is an attractive choice. These policies also encourage the
development of centers as places that reflect the character and cultures
of the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.20 Walkable scale.</strong> Focus services and higher-density
housing in the core of centers to support a critical mass of demand for
commercial services and more walkable access for customers.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.21 Street environment.</strong> Encourage development in centers and
corridors to include amenities that create a pedestrian-oriented
environment and provide places for people to sit, spend time, and
gather.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.22 Relationship between building height and street size.</strong>
Encourage development in centers and corridors that is responsive to
street space width, thus allowing taller buildings on wider streets.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.23 Design for pedestrian and bicycle access.</strong> Provide
accessible sidewalks, high-quality bicycle access, and frequent street
connections and crossings in centers and corridors.</p>
<p>**Designing with nature<br>
**Incorporating natural features and functions into development improves
human and ecological health, yielding tangible social, environmental,
and economic benefits. Designing with nature provides or enhances
ecosystem services, such as stormwater management, cooling of air and
water, reduction of landslide, wildfire and flooding risks, protection
or enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat, and opportunities for
Portlanders to enjoy nature in their daily lives. These policies apply
to a broad range of land uses and development sites, encouraging
development designed to enhance the identity and beauty of Portland’s
neighborhoods, business districts, and industrial districts, while
improving watershed health and resilience to climate change.</p>
<p><em>Additional goals and policies about the integration of nature into the
built environment and infrastructure are found in Chapter 7: Environment
and Watershed Health, Chapter 8: Public Facilities and Services, and
Chapter 9: Transportation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.73 Design with nature.</strong> Encourage design and site
development practices that enhance, and avoid the degradation of,
watershed health and ecosystem services and that incorporate trees and
vegetation.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.74 Flexible development options.</strong> Encourage flexibility in
the division of land, the siting and design of buildings, and other
improvements to reduce the impact of development on
environmentally-sensitive areas and to retain healthy native and
beneficial vegetation and trees.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.75 Low-impact development and best practices.</strong> Encourage use
of low-impact development, habitat-friendly development, bird-friendly
design, and green infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.76 Impervious surfaces.</strong> Limit use of and strive to reduce
impervious surfaces and associated impacts on hydrologic function, air
and water quality, habitat connectivity, tree canopy, and urban heat
island effects.</p>
