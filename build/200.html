                  <p>un­de­ﬁned<strong>Transportation Goals (Comp Plan Chapter 9)</strong></p>
<p>**Safety (Comp Plan Goal 9.A)
**The City achieves the stan­dard of zero traf­ﬁc-re­lated fa­tal­i­ties and se­ri­ous in­juries. Transportation safety im­pacts the liv­abil­ity of a city and the com­fort and se­cu­rity of those us­ing City streets. Comprehensive ef­forts to im­prove trans­porta­tion safety through eq­uity, en­gi­neer­ing, ed­u­ca­tion, en­force­ment and eval­u­a­tion will be used to elim­i­nate traf­ﬁc-re­lated fa­tal­i­ties and se­ri­ous in­juries from Portland’s trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</p>
<p>**Multiple goals (Comp Plan Goal 9.B)
**Portland’s trans­porta­tion sys­tem is funded and main­tained to achieve mul­ti­ple goals and mea­sure­able out­comes for peo­ple and the en­vi­ron­ment. The trans­porta­tion sys­tem is safe, com­plete, in­ter­con­nected, mul­ti­modal, and ful­ﬁlls daily needs for peo­ple and busi­nesses.</p>
<p>**Great places (Comp Plan Goal 9.C)
**Portland’s trans­porta­tion sys­tem en­hances qual­ity of life for all Portlanders, re­in­forces ex­ist­ing neigh­bor­hoods and great places, and helps make new great places in town cen­ters, neigh­bor­hood cen­ters and cor­ri­dors, and civic cor­ri­dors.</p>
<p>**Environmentally sus­tain­able (Comp Plan Goal 9.D)
**The trans­porta­tion sys­tem in­creas­ingly uses ac­tive trans­porta­tion, re­new­able en­ergy, or elec­tric­ity from re­new­able sources, achieves adopted car­bon re­duc­tion tar­gets, and re­duces air pol­lu­tion, wa­ter pol­lu­tion, noise, and Portlanders’ re­liance on pri­vate ve­hi­cles.</p>
<p>**Equitable trans­porta­tion (Comp Plan Goal 9.E)
**The trans­porta­tion sys­tem pro­vides all Portlanders op­tions to move about the city and meet their daily needs by us­ing a va­ri­ety of safe, ef­ﬁ­cient, con­ve­nient, and af­ford­able modes of trans­porta­tion. Transportation in­vest­ments are re­spon­sive to the dis­tinct needs of each com­mu­nity.</p>
<p>**Positive health out­comes (Comp Plan Goal 9.F)
**The trans­porta­tion sys­tem pro­motes pos­i­tive health out­comes and min­i­mizes neg­a­tive im­pacts for all Portlanders by sup­port­ing ac­tive trans­porta­tion, phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity, and com­mu­nity and in­di­vid­ual health.</p>
<p>**Opportunities for pros­per­ity (Comp Plan Goal 9.G)
**The trans­porta­tion sys­tem sup­ports a strong and di­verse econ­omy, en­hances the com­pet­i­tive­ness of the city and re­gion, and main­tains Portland’s role as a West Coast trade gate­way and freight hub by pro­vid­ing ef­ﬁ­cient and re­li­able goods move­ment, mul­ti­modal ac­cess to em­ploy­ment ar­eas and ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions, as well as en­hanced freight ac­cess to in­dus­trial ar­eas and in­ter­modal freight fa­cil­i­ties. The trans­porta­tion sys­tem helps peo­ple and busi­nesses re­duce spend­ing and keep money in the lo­cal econ­omy by pro­vid­ing af­ford­able al­ter­na­tives to dri­ving.</p>
<p>**Cost ef­fec­tive­ness (Comp Plan Goal 9.H)
**The City an­a­lyzes and pri­or­i­tizes cap­i­tal and op­er­at­ing in­vest­ments to cost ef­fec­tively achieve the above goals while re­spon­si­bly man­ag­ing and pro­tect­ing our past in­vest­ments in ex­ist­ing as­sets.</p>
<p>**Airport fu­tures (Comp Plan Goal 9.I)
**Promote a sus­tain­able air­port (Portland International Airport [<span class="small-caps">PDX</span>]) by meet­ing the re­gion’s air trans­porta­tion needs with­out com­pro­mis­ing liv­abil­ity and qual­ity of life for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
<p>Public Facilities and Services Goals (Comp Plan Chapter 8)</p>
<p>**Public rights-of-way (Comp Plan Goal 8.D)
**Public rights-of-way en­hance the pub­lic realm and pro­vide a multi-pur­pose, con­nected, safe, and healthy phys­i­cal space for move­ment and travel, pub­lic and pri­vate util­i­ties, and other ap­pro­pri­ate pub­lic func­tions and uses.
<strong>Urban Form Goals (Comp Plan Chapter 3)</strong></p>
<p>**A city de­signed for peo­ple (Comp Plan Goal 3.A)
**Portland’s built en­vi­ron­ment is de­signed to serve the needs and as­pi­ra­tions of all Portlanders, pro­mot­ing pros­per­ity, health, eq­uity, and re­siliency. New de­vel­op­ment, re­de­vel­op­ment, and pub­lic in­vest­ments re­duce dis­par­i­ties and en­cour­age so­cial in­ter­ac­tion to cre­ate a healthy con­nected city.</p>
<p>**A cli­mate and haz­ard re­silient ur­ban form (Comp Plan Goal 3.B)
**Portland’s com­pact ur­ban form, sus­tain­able build­ing de­vel­op­ment prac­tices, green in­fra­struc­ture, and ac­tive trans­porta­tion sys­tem re­duce car­bon emis­sions, re­duce nat­ural haz­ard risks and im­pacts, and im­prove re­silience to the ef­fects of cli­mate change.</p>
<p>**Focused growth (Comp Plan Goal 3.C)
**Household and em­ploy­ment growth is fo­cused in the Central City and other cen­ters, cor­ri­dors, and tran­sit sta­tion ar­eas, cre­at­ing com­pact ur­ban de­vel­op­ment in ar­eas with a high level of ser­vice and ameni­ties, while al­low­ing the rel­a­tive sta­bil­ity of lower-den­sity sin­gle-fam­ily res­i­den­tial ar­eas.</p>
<p>**A sys­tem of cen­ters and cor­ri­dors (Comp Plan Goal 3.D)
**Portland’s in­ter­con­nected sys­tem of cen­ters and cor­ri­dors pro­vides di­verse hous­ing op­tions and em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, ro­bust mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion con­nec­tions, ac­cess to lo­cal ser­vices and ameni­ties, and sup­ports low-car­bon com­plete, healthy, and eq­ui­table com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
<p>**Connected pub­lic realm and open spaces (Comp Plan Goal 3.E)
**A net­work of parks, streets, City Greenways, and other pub­lic spaces sup­ports com­mu­nity in­ter­ac­tion; con­nects neigh­bor­hoods, dis­tricts, and des­ti­na­tions; and im­proves air, wa­ter, land qual­ity, and en­vi­ron­men­tal health.</p>
<p><strong>Design and Development Goals (Comp Plan Chapter 4)</strong></p>
<p>**Context-sensitive de­sign and de­vel­op­ment (Comp Plan Goal 4.A)
**New de­vel­op­ment is de­signed to re­spond to and en­hance the dis­tinc­tive phys­i­cal, his­toric, and cul­tural qual­i­ties of its lo­ca­tion, while ac­com­mo­dat­ing growth and change.</p>
<p>**Human and en­vi­ron­men­tal health (Comp Plan Goal 4.C)
**Neighborhoods and de­vel­op­ment are ef­ﬁ­ciently de­signed and built to en­hance hu­man and en­vi­ron­men­tal health: they pro­tect safety and liv­abil­ity; sup­port lo­cal ac­cess to healthy food; limit neg­a­tive im­pacts on wa­ter, hy­drol­ogy, and air qual­ity; re­duce car­bon emis­sions; en­cour­age ac­tive and sus­tain­able de­sign; pro­tect wildlife; ad­dress ur­ban heat is­lands; and in­te­grate na­ture and the built en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="small-caps">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The pur­pose of the mas­ter street plans is to in­crease the ef­ﬁ­ciency of the trans­porta­tion sys­tem through in­creased street con­nec­tiv­ity and a ﬁner mesh of pedes­trian and bike­ways. A dense grid of streets helps spread lo­cal ve­hi­cle trips more evenly over the lo­cal street net­work and re­duces con­ges­tion on the ar­te­r­ial sys­tem. Studies show that im­proved lo­cal street con­nec­tiv­ity im­proves ar­te­r­ial sys­tem ca­pac­ity by as much as 25 per­cent.</p>
<p>Studies show that dis­tance is one of the most im­por­tant fac­tors in mode choice. The lack of a dense grid of streets and pedes­trian/​bi­cy­cle con­nec­tions re­sults in out-of-di­rec­tion travel that is par­tic­u­larly dis­cour­ag­ing to po­ten­tial pedes­tri­ans and bi­cy­clists. The re­sult is in­creased use of the au­to­mo­bile for trips to nearby (as the crow ﬂies) des­ti­na­tions. Trips need to be rel­a­tively short <em>and di­rect</em> to en­cour­age travel on foot or by bi­cy­cle.</p>
<p>Good street con­nec­tiv­ity im­proves emer­gency re­sponse times. Police, ﬁre, and am­bu­lance ser­vices can reach their des­ti­na­tions more quickly be­cause there is less out-of-di­rec­tion travel. Multiple ac­cess routes can re­duce travel times and pro­vide ac­cess op­tions if one route is blocked.</p>
<p>Good lo­cal street con­nec­tions can re­duce traf­ﬁc vol­umes on other streets by spread­ing traf­ﬁc over a denser net­work. With more in­ter­sec­tions, traf­ﬁc also moves more slowly be­cause side street traf­ﬁc and stop signs dis­cour­age dri­vers from speed­ing.</p>
<p>As prop­er­ties are sub­di­vided and de­vel­oped, ac­cess needs are met pri­mar­ily through new streets. The City’s lo­cal street net­work has grown over time, as out­ly­ing ar­eas be­came more ur­ban­ized or older ar­eas are re­de­vel­oped. In the past, de­vel­op­ment was not al­ways re­quired to ad­dress con­nec­tions to ad­ja­cent ar­eas as well as in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion. The re­sult has been large ar­eas of the City with poor con­nec­tiv­ity, par­tic­u­larly in newer ar­eas where the coun­ties pre­vi­ously reg­u­lated de­vel­op­ment.</p>
<p><strong>State Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Street con­nec­tiv­ity must be part of trans­porta­tion sys­tem plans (TSPs) and adopt­ing Ordinances. The Oregon Administrative Rule for State Land Use Goal 12, Transportation, Section 660-012-0020, Elements of Transportation Systems Plans, re­quires:</p>
<p>A road plan for a sys­tem of ar­te­ri­als and col­lec­tors and stan­dards for the lay­out of lo­cal streets and other im­por­tant non-col­lec­tor street con­nec­tions… The stan­dards for the lay­out of lo­cal streets shall pro­vide for safe and con­ve­nient bike and pedes­trian cir­cu­la­tion nec­es­sary to carry out <span class="small-caps">OAR</span> 660-012-045(3)(b).</p>
<p>The State Transportation Planning Rule (<span class="small-caps">TPR</span>) states that the in­tent of the re­quire­ment is to pro­vide guid­ance on the spac­ing of fu­ture ex­ten­sions and con­nec­tions along ex­ist­ing and fu­ture streets that are needed to pro­vide rea­son­ably di­rect routes for bi­cy­cle and pedes­trian travel.</p>
<p>The rule ref­er­enced above goes on to state:</p>
<p>On-site fa­cil­i­ties shall be pro­vided which ac­com­mo­date safe and con­ve­nient pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle ac­cess from within new sub­di­vi­sions, multi-fam­ily de­vel­op­ments, planned de­vel­op­ments, shop­ping cen­ters, and com­mer­cial dis­tricts to ad­ja­cent res­i­den­tial ar­eas and tran­sit stops, and to neigh­bor­hood ac­tiv­ity cen­ters within one-half mile of the de­vel­op­ment. Single-family res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ments shall gen­er­ally in­clude streets and ac­cess­ways. Pedestrian cir­cu­la­tion through park­ing lots should gen­er­ally be pro­vided in the form of ac­cess­ways.</p>
<p>The <span class="small-caps">TPR</span> also states that lo­cal ju­ris­dic­tions should es­tab­lish their own stan­dards or cri­te­ria for pro­vid­ing streets and ac­cess­ways con­sis­tent with the in­tent stated above. This may be ac­com­plished through stan­dards for spac­ing of streets or ac­cess­ways, and stan­dards for ex­ces­sive out-of-di­rec­tion travel. The <span class="small-caps">TPR</span> de­ﬁnes<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>safe and con­ve­nient’ ac­cess as be­ing:</p>
<p>● Reasonably free from haz­ards</p>
<p>● Meeting the needs of cy­clists and pedes­tri­ans, con­sid­er­ing des­ti­na­tion and length of trip</p>
<p><strong>Metro Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (<span class="small-caps">RTFP</span>), adopted in 2010 (Ordinance 10-1241B) and up­dated in 2012, re­quires ju­ris­dic­tions to im­ple­ment two types of street plans:</p>

<p><strong>Areas Meeting Connectivity Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Many ar­eas of Portland meet the <span class="small-caps">RTP</span> con­nec­tiv­ity stan­dards or are not re­quired to have mas­ter street plans. The dis­trict maps in Chapter 2 of the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> (Maps 11.11.9-11.11.16) show these ar­eas. Areas not re­quired to meet con­nec­tiv­ity stan­dards in­clude in­dus­trial sanc­tu­ar­ies, open space, and pro­tected en­vi­ron­men­tal ar­eas.

<p><strong>Existing Master Street Plans</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Southwest and Far Southeast</em></strong></p>
<p>The City com­pleted mas­ter street plans for the Southwest and Far Southeast trans­porta­tion dis­tricts in June 2001. These two mas­ter street plans sat­isfy the State and re­gional re­quire­ments to iden­tify the lo­ca­tion and type of new lo­cal street con­nec­tions. The method­ol­ogy and cri­te­ria used to de­velop the plans are de­scribed brieﬂy be­low. The <span class="small-caps">SW</span> and Far <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Master Street Plan&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Final Report and Recommendations con­tains quar­ter-sec­tion level maps and ta­bles that de­tail the rec­om­mended con­nec­tions. The re­port iden­ti­ﬁes three ob­jec­tives to be met:</p>
<p>● Reduce the un­cer­tainty in the de­vel­op­ment re­view process re­gard­ing when and where new street con­nec­tions will be an is­sue.</p>
<p>● Provide for bet­ter co­or­di­na­tion of the lo­cal street sys­tem de­vel­op­ment.</p>
<p>● Comply with the man­dates of the State Transportation Planning Rule and Regional Transportation Plan for street con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
<p>The Southwest and Far Southeast mas­ter street plans were de­vel­oped through a num­ber of steps, with map­ping as­so­ci­ated with each step:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Step One*</p>
<p>● Deﬁne blocks in the study area that meet the spac­ing stan­dard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>● Deﬁne ar­eas be­ing ex­cluded (areas where streets are com­plete or un­der­way; parcels zoned as park, open space, or in­dus­trial; re­li­gious or ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Step Two</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>● Deﬁne re­main­ing ar­eas that have de­vel­op­ment or re­de­vel­op­ment po­ten­tial (land value greater than im­prove­ment value; dif­fer­ent Comprehensive Plan and zon­ing des­ig­na­tions; two-acre or larger parcels).</p>
<p>● Deﬁne de­vel­op­ment con­straints (street spac­ing not met, but parcels don’t meet de­vel­op­ment po­ten­tial).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Step Three</em></p>
<p>● Deﬁne blocks with bar­ri­ers to con­nec­tiv­ity (environmentally con­strained).</p>
<p>*Step Four *</p>
<p>● Group the re­main­ing ar­eas into fo­cus ar­eas.</p>
<p>*Step Five *</p>
<p>● Deﬁne lo­ca­tions of new con­nec­tions.</p>
<p>● Determine speci­ﬁcity of con­nec­tions&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;spe­ciﬁc points or along a block face).</p>
<p>● Apply type of con­nec­tion&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;street or pedes­trian/​bi­cy­cle.</p>
<p>The plan’s rec­om­men­da­tions in­clude in­for­ma­tion about the lo­ca­tion, level of align­ment speci­ﬁcity, type of con­nec­tion, bar­ri­ers, pres­ence of en­vi­ron­men­tal zones, traf­ﬁc im­pacts, ﬁeld notes, and com­ments from the pub­lic or tech­ni­cal staff.</p>
<p>While the mas­ter street plans iden­tify a num­ber of fu­ture con­nec­tions, the ab­sence of a con­nec­tion does not mean a con­nec­tion is not needed or fea­si­ble. All ar­eas within the study ar­eas are still sub­ject to rel­e­vant pol­icy and spac­ing stan­dards.</p>
<p><strong><em>Area-Speciﬁc Master Street Plans</em></strong></p>
<p>Street plans have been com­pleted, but not adopted into the Comprehensive Plan, for other ar­eas of the City over the past sev­eral years. Although they are not specif­i­cally in­tended to meet the</p>
<p>State and re­gional re­quire­ments, they do func­tion as mas­ter street plans. These plans cover the fol­low­ing ar­eas:</p>
<p>● Gateway Regional Center</p>
<p>● Airport Way (Columbia Corridor)</p>
<p>● Bridgeton (Northeast dis­trict ad­ja­cent to Marine Drive)</p>
<p>● South Portland (west end of the Ross Island Bridge)</p>
<p>● South Waterfront (Central City)</p>
<p>● River District (Central City)</p>
<p>● Cully Local Street Plan</p>
<p>● Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan</p>
<p>● Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</p>
<p>Each plan or study is sum­ma­rized be­low, along with maps de­rived from the orig­i­nal doc­u­ments.</p>
<p><strong><em>Areas Not Covered by Master Street Plans</em></strong></p>
<p>Master Street plans have not been com­pleted for all or parts of the North, Northeast, Far Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Central City dis­tricts. Other ar­eas were ex­cluded from the Southwest and Far Southeast Master Street Plans: the east light rail cor­ri­dor (102&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; to the city lim­its, <span class="small-caps">NE</span> Glisan to <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Stark), the Hillsdale town cen­ter, and the West Portland town cen­ter. Master Street plans for these ar­eas will be com­pleted as re­ﬁne­ment plans of the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span>. Until such plans are com­pleted, the lo­ca­tion and im­ple­men­ta­tion of new street and pedes­trian/​bi­cy­cle con­nec­tions will be gov­erned by Title 17: Public Improvements, and Title 33: Planning and Zoning, re­quire­ments in City Code. Title 17 reg­u­la­tions gov­ern de­vel­op­ing or re­de­vel­op­ing sites that do not in­clude a land di­vi­sion, and Title 33 reg­u­la­tions gov­ern de­vel­op­ing or re­de­vel­op­ing sites that do in­clude a land di­vi­sion. The spac­ing stan­dards in each ti­tle are 530 feet for full street con­nec­tions and 330 feet for pedes­trian/​bi­cy­cle con­nec­tions where full street con­nec­tions are not fea­si­ble.</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>In 1996, the Portland City Council ac­cepted the City Engineer’s Report ti­tled North Macadam District Street Plan, which iden­ti­ﬁed and clas­si­ﬁed a street sys­tem for the North Macadam District. On January 20, 2003, City Council adopted amend­ments to the Central City Plan and up­dated the District’s spe­cial de­sign guide­lines and the zon­ing code. At the same time, City Council changed the North Macadam District name to South Waterfront District (the District). By au­thor­ity of the City Engineer un­der Title 17 City Code, the South Waterfront Street Plan, Criteria and Standards was amended in 2007 pro­vid­ing up­dated de­sign cri­te­ria and stan­dard de­tails for the District’s pub­lic rights-of-way. The 2009 doc­u­ment up­date amends the North District (the area south of Sheridan St and north of Gibbs St) rights-of-way align­ment and stan­dards to ac­com­mo­date fu­ture light rail and prop­erty de­vel­op­ment, as well as ex­panded street­car ser­vice and bi­cy­cle and pedes­trian in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
<p>The South Waterfront District of the Central City of Portland lies along the Willamette River and south of down­town. The dis­trict bound­aries are the River, Interstate 5, the Marquam Bridge and <span class="small-caps">SW</span> Hamilton Court. Adopted City pol­icy en­vi­sions this as a mixed-use neigh­bor­hood with sig­nif­i­cant res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ment along the River and com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ment fo­cused along tran­sit cor­ri­dors. With just over one mile of River frontage the District con­tains ap­prox­i­mately 140 acres. Some land is de­vel­oped or be­ing de­vel­oped and some land is va­cant land or has re­de­vel­op­ment po­ten­tial.</p>
<p>The pri­mary de­vel­op­ment con­straint in the District is trans­porta­tion ac­cess to and from re­gional high­way and tran­sit sys­tems. The South Waterfront Plan of January 20, 2003 in­cludes a vi­sion, poli­cies and an Urban Design Plan that pro­motes high den­sity hous­ing and com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ment with a full range of busi­nesses that con­tribute to the re­gion’s job growth. The vi­sion also in­cludes fre­quent pub­lic con­nec­tions to the river, lim­it­ing the size and amount of sur­face park­ing lots, and in­te­grat­ing de­vel­op­ment and ser­vices.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=“me­dia/​im­age07.png” width=“516” height=“802” /&gt;</p>
<p>In 1998 the North Macadam District Street Design Standards and Criteria Plan: Transportation Report con­sid­ered and an­a­lyzed South Waterfront’s lim­ited ac­cess and ad­ja­cency to I-5 and Ross Island Bridge ramps. The analy­sis in­cluded the three dis­trict por­tal in­ter­sec­tions: River Parkway and Harbor Drive (north), Curry and Macadam (center) and Bancroft and Macadam (south). The analy­sis was based on the District’s 20-year goals for ac­com­mo­dat­ing 10,000 jobs and 3,000 hous­ing units and a 30 per­cent mode split. The hous­ing goal has since been in­creased to 5,000 units.</p>
<p>Conclusions were:</p>
<p>● Bancroft and Macadam por­tal im­prove­ments would ac­com­mo­date traf­ﬁc growth and tran­sit ac­cess at ac­cept­able lev­els of ser­vice. South Waterfront (North Macadam District) be­came part of the Central City in 1988.</p>
<p>● Moving the cen­tral por­tal from Gibbs to Curry and im­prov­ing the Curry and Macadam in­ter­sec­tion would bet­ter ac­com­mo­date traf­ﬁc op­er­a­tion, growth and ac­cess from I-5 to the District.</p>
<p>● As the District’s growth nears 10,000 jobs and 5,000 hous­ing units, por­tal ac­cess will de­grade and as a re­sult func­tion at a mar­gin­ally ac­cept­able level.</p>
<p>● River Parkway and Harbor Drive would op­er­ate at ac­cept­able lev­els al­though back­ups on I-5 and Naito Parkway could in­ter­fere with op­er­a­tions on a more fre­quent ba­sis in the fu­ture.</p>
<p>The 1998 trans­porta­tion analy­sis demon­strated that while the District will ex­pe­ri­ence in­creased con­ges­tion over time, the por­tal ca­pac­ity with the iden­ti­ﬁed por­tal im­prove­ments and in­creased tran­sit ser­vice should con­tinue to pro­vide ac­cept­able lev­els of ser­vice to the District and the re­gional trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</p>
<p>Since the 1998 re­port, plans for por­tal im­prove­ments have been al­tered. Through the South Portal Study, con­ducted in 2006, the rec­om­mended south por­tal shifted south to Hamilton St and Macadam. In ad­di­tion, the planned cen­tral por­tal im­prove­ments at Curry have been scaled back and north por­tal im­prove­ments at River Parkway and Harbor Drive have been added. In fact, in 2009 the Portland Bureau of Transportation up­dated the tech­ni­cal analy­sis through the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy (resolution no. 36696 adopted April 8, 2009). The re­port iden­ti­ﬁed multi-modal pro­ject pri­or­i­ties and a fund­ing strat­egy to guide pro­ject im­ple­men­ta­tion nec­es­sary to sup­port con­tin­ued de­vel­op­ment of the ur­ban re­newal area, in­clud­ing por­tal im­prove­ments.</p>
<p>The 2007 up­date of the South Waterfront District Street Plan, Criteria and Standards pri­mar­ily re­sponded to de­vel­op­ment in the Central District and com­ple­tion of in­fra­struc­ture pro­jects, in­clud­ing the Portland Streetcar ex­ten­sion to Lowell St and the Portland Aerial Tram to Oregon Health Sciences University. Transportation stud­ies, such as the 2004 South Waterfront District Transportation Improvements Evaluation and 2006 South Portal Study had also been com­pleted. Major up­dates in­cluded changes to the street light­ing de­sign stan­dards, cer­tain street fur­ni­ture stan­dards, and the mod­i­ﬁ­ca­tion of the street plan based on the rec­om­men­da­tions of the South Portal Study and the new Greenstreet Policy (resolution no. 36500 adopted in April of 2007). Other changes in­cluded mod­est re­ﬁne­ments to var­i­ous street di­men­sional stan­dards de­vel­oped through pre­lim­i­nary en­gi­neer­ing and con­struc­tion of these streets and to re­ﬁne­ments of var­i­ous per­for­mance cri­te­ria.

<p><strong>2009 Update</strong></p>
<p>Since the 2007 up­date, the City of Portland has en­dorsed the lo­cally Preferred Alternative (<span class="small-caps">LPA</span>) for the Portland to Milwaukie Light Rail align­ment. This align­ment ex­tended light rail south into the North District and in­clude bus ser­vice and street­car uti­liz­ing the same align­ment. In ad­di­tion, the <span class="small-caps">OHSU</span> Schnitzer Campus mas­ter plan and the North Macadam Transportation Development Strategy re­port, with a pri­or­i­tized list of multi-modal pro­jects and a fund­ing strat­egy, have been com­pleted. These ac­tiv­i­ties gen­er­ated the need to re­ﬁne and up­date var­i­ous el­e­ments of the Street Plan. Major up­dates in­clude changes to the street align­ments and des­ig­na­tions in the Concept Street Plan Map, up­dates of some street widths in the Right-of-Way Width Map changes to street de­scrip­tions in the Street Classiﬁcation and Function Table, and ad­just­ments to the Standard Street Sections.</p>
<p>Speciﬁc changes made to the Concept Street Plan map are as fol­lows:</p>
<p>● Bond Ave ex­tends north through the District.</p>
<p>● Bond Ave is one-way north­bound through the District.</p>
<p>● Moody Ave is one-way south­bound for ve­hic­u­lar traf­ﬁc through the District; and one-way south­bound for street­car south of Woods St.</p>
<p>● Moody Ave re­mains two-way street­car north of Woods St.</p>
<p>● Moody Ave in­cludes a two-way bike path along the west-side to min­i­mize bike/​street­car in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
<p>● The grades of Moody Ave and Porter St are raised to a level con­sis­tent with the Willamette River Crossing Partnership ﬁnd­ings nec­es­sary for light rail.</p>
<p>● Porter St car­ries light rail, street­car and bus in two di­rec­tions only; pri­vate ve­hi­cles are not ac­com­mo­dated on this street.</p>
<p>● River Pkwy (south of the Marquam Bridge) ter­mi­nates at Woods St.</p>
<p>● Alignments are ad­justed for lo­cal east-west streets north of Gibbs St.</p>
<p>●<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Special Design Area” be­neath the Ross Island Bridge has been re­lo­cated to re­ﬂect the lo­ca­tion of the po­ten­tial ac­tive-use park. Grover St is aligned on ei­ther side of the Ross Island Bridge.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The 2040 Growth Concept iden­ti­ﬁes the Gateway re­gional cen­ter as the only re­gional cen­ter in Portland. Planning for Gateway be­gan with the Outer Southeast Community Plan and con­tin­ued with the Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy. City Council ac­cepted Opportunity Gateway in February 2000 (Resolution No. 35867). The Outer Southeast Community Plan re­sulted in a plan dis­trict and tran­sit-sup­port­ive zon­ing</p>
<p>The Central Gateway por­tion of the Gateway District Master Street Plan was amended in 2009. This amend­ment was based on a rec­om­men­da­tion in the Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy, which was adopted by the Portland Development Commission in August 2007. The Central Gateway Redevelopment Strategy con­cluded that the street plan for Central Gateway should be up­dated, with the goal of in­creas­ing con­nec­tiv­ity in Central Gateway, pro­vid­ing greater cer­tainty to de­vel­op­ers about street re­quire­ments and open­ing up parcels to re­de­vel­op­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Street Connectivity</strong></p>
<p>A dis­con­tin­u­ous net­work of streets and side­walks, high vol­umes of through-traf­ﬁc, and un­der­uti­lized prop­erty char­ac­ter­ize Gateway re­gional cen­ter. Access to the tran­sit sta­tions in Gateway’s north­west cor­ner and at 102&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and Burnside is prob­lem­atic. Discontinuous streets dis­cour­age walk­ing and bi­cy­cling, re­sult­ing in sig­nif­i­cant out-of-di­rec­tion travel for all modes.</p>
<p>Increasing street con­nec­tiv­ity would dis­perse trips among many al­ter­nate routes, thereby re­duc­ing con­ges­tion, short­en­ing trip lengths, and in­creas­ing the mode split for al­ter­na­tives to the au­to­mo­bile.</p>
<p><strong>Concept Plan Map</strong></p>
<p>The Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan and Redevelopment Strategy is in­tended to serve as the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>appropriate vi­sion’ for the re­de­vel­op­ment of Gateway as a re­gional cen­ter. The con­cept plan map is a pic­ture of the re­gional cen­ter’s re­de­vel­op­ment po­ten­tial and build-out in 2019. While the plan map af­ﬁxes build­ings and parks to spe­ciﬁc lo­ca­tions, the re­al­ity is that new con­struc­tion will ap­pear some­what dif­fer­ently. While new streets and con­nec­tions are iden­ti­ﬁed, they are also sub­ject to change to re­spond to de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. The Opportunity Gateway re­port states:<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>It is rigid enough to be a state­ment of what is and is not de­sir­able in the</p>
<p>Regional Center, and ﬂex­i­ble enough to be use­ful even as re­de­vel­op­ment cir­cum­stances change.” The map graph­i­cally de­picts the vi­sion de­scribed in the re­port.</p>
<p>The con­cept plan map calls for a tra­di­tional block con­ﬁg­u­ra­tion, which will help unify the re­gional cen­ter’s char­ac­ter. Some of the pro­posed new con­nec­tions would greatly change ex­ist­ing cir­cu­la­tion pat­terns. Northeast Multnomah be­tween Fred Meyer’s and Mervyn’s at the Gateway Shopping Center is shown as a fully func­tional street, in­tended to help dis­perse traf­ﬁc as­so­ci­ated with the tran­sit cen­ter. In the south­ern part of the re­gional cen­ter, sev­eral new pub­lic streets are shown in the Mall 205 and Plaza 205 prop­er­ties, break­ing up what are now large ex­panses of park­ing. Pedestrian path­ways con­nect im­por­tant routes and des­ti­na­tions where full streets are not pos­si­ble or ap­pro­pri­ate, such as be­tween <span class="small-caps">SE</span> 105&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and the Adventist Medical Center.</p>
<p>As the ma­jor north-south ar­te­r­ial, 102&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Avenue is the spine of the dis­trict and is tar­geted for im­prove­ments for all modes. Changes to 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Avenue would al­low it to act as an ad­di­tional north-south car­rier, im­prov­ing ac­cess for de­vel­op­ment pro­jects and cre­at­ing a new lo­cal iden­tity the length of the dis­trict. Major east-west streets (Stark/Washington, Halsey/Weidler, Burnside, and Glisan) will con­tinue to carry sig­nif­i­cant vol­umes of through-traf­ﬁc. Better lo­cal north-south street con­nec­tions will link the two main large shop­ping ar­eas to­gether, and im­proved con­nec­tiv­ity will be pro­vided within each of these shop­ping ar­eas.</p>

<p><strong>Central Gateway Street Plan 2009</strong></p>
<p>The Central Gateway Master Street Plan re­vi­sion was de­vel­oped to pro­vide ﬂex­i­bil­ity for con­nec­tions while main­tain­ing larger parcels for re­de­vel­op­ment, rec­og­niz­ing ex­ist­ing par­cel lines, pro­vide con­nec­tions on the lo­cal net­work with­out al­ter­ing the dis­trict or neigh­bor­hood col­lec­tors and to fos­ter re­de­vel­op­ment in the City’s only re­gional Center. Criteria was es­tab­lished for con­sid­er­a­tion in the pro­posed plan. Other goals of the plan in­cluded align­ing streets on par­cel bound­aries for shared in­vest­ment in right-of-way im­prove­ments; con­sider com­mon or mul­ti­ple par­cel own­er­ship; min­i­mize par­cel im­pacts and main­tain re­minder parcels; pre­serve some large parcels or con­tigu­ous own­er­ship parcels; dis­cour­age cut-through traf­ﬁc while pro­vid­ing ac­cess; dis­cour­age off-set in­ter­sec­tions; con­sider po­ten­tial spac­ing of cross­walks or sig­nals.</p>
<p>With these cri­te­ria and goals, a re­vised street plan for Central Gateway was de­vel­oped. The re­vised street plan pro­vided needed multi-modal con­nec­tions within the Central Gateway area with­out chang­ing the func­tion of the ma­jor traf­ﬁc streets and col­lec­tors sur­round­ing the area, such as 102nd Ave., Glisan, Burnside, and Stark.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the re­vised street plan:</p>
<p>East-west con­nec­tions be­tween 97th Ave. and 102nd Ave. on Flanders St. and Davis St. North-south con­nec­tion on 100th Ave. be­tween Oak St. and Burnside and also be­tween Oregon St. and Paciﬁc St.</p>
<p>North–south con­nec­tion on 101st Ave. be­tween Stark St. and ap­prox­i­mately Flanders St., im­prov­ing multi-modal ac­cess to the light-rail sta­tion on 102nd and Burnside.</p>
<p>Internal con­nec­tion on Oregon St. ap­prox­i­mately Hoyt St., Coach St., and 101st Ave.</p>
<p>Vacating por­tions of 97th Ave. to al­low de­vel­opable parcels near I-205. This would con­tinue to al­low multi-modal ac­cess to the parcels.</p>
<p>Maintaining ex­ist­ing large parcels for de­vel­op­ment and re­de­vel­op­ment while also pro­vid­ing pub­lic bi­cy­cle and pedes­trian ac­cess ways. Large parcels would have the op­tion to have pub­lic bike and pedes­trian ac­cess ways on the site rather than full streets, as was re­quired in the prior mas­ter street plan. Public bike and pedes­trian ac­cess ways will be re­quired on cer­tain blocks such that spac­ing of pub­lic con­nec­tions shall be no more than 330 feet where full street con­nec­tions are more than 530 feet. Additionally, pedes­trian con­nec­tions would be re­quired through­out Central Gateway.</p>
<p>Because large parcels were main­tained for de­vel­op­ment and re­de­vel­op­ment, the re­vised street plan does not in­clude some of the pro­posed streets that were in the pre­vi­ous in the street plan for the Gateway District. These in­clude:</p>
<p>Extension of Oregon St. be­tween 97th Ave. and 98th Ave. However, the re­vised street plan pro­poses to keep the Irving St. align­ment as ex­ist­ing be­tween 97th Ave. and 100th Ave., whereas the prior plan showed this seg­ment as va­cated.</p>
<p>Full street con­nec­tion of Hoyt St. be­tween 97th Ave. and 104th Ave.</p>
<p>Full street con­nec­tion of roughly the Davis St. align­ment be­tween 97th Ave. and 103rd Ave. The re­vised street plan pro­poses that some por­tions of the align­ment would be full street while other por­tions would be pedes­trian con­nec­tion.</p>
<p>Extension of 101st Ave. be­tween Washington St. and Paciﬁc St. The re­vised street plan pro­poses a mix of full streets and pedes­trian con­nec­tions on some por­tions of the 101st Ave. align­ment. Other por­tions of the align­ment would not have con­nec­tions. Unlike as in the prior plan, the re­vised street plan does not in­tend for 10st Ave. to be­come a neigh­bor­hood col­lec­tor. Rather, 99th Ave. would be a through street, with 100th Ave. also pro­vid­ing sig­nif­i­cant con­nec­tiv­ity.)</p>
<p>Extension of 100th Ave. be­tween Oak St. and Washington St. (The re­vised street plan does not in­clude any con­nec­tiv­ity at this lo­ca­tion. Vehicles, pedes­tri­ans, and bi­cy­cles could ac­cess the area from con­nec­tions at 97th Ave., and 101st.</p>
<p><strong>Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan (2012)</strong></p>
<p>The Cully Commercial Corridor and Local Street Plan was adopted by Resolution 36952 in August 2012. Its de­vel­op­ment was funded by a Transportation Growth Management Grant from the Oregon Department of Transportation. Its rec­om­men­da­tions were also in­ﬂu­enced by the Portland Plan (April 2012) which had rec­om­men­da­tions re­lated to al­ter­na­tive right of way im­prove­ments, de­vel­op­ing new op­tions for unim­proved rights-of-way and ac­cel­er­at­ing the cre­ation of safe pedes­trian con­nec­tions. The Cully Neighborhood Local Street Plan iden­ti­ﬁed new street or pedes­trian/​bi­cy­cle con­nec­tions to im­prove street con­nec­tiv­ity and ad­dress gaps in trans­porta­tion net­works.</p>

<p><strong>Study Area</strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast Portland Master Street Plan in­cludes nearly all of the Far Southeast Transportation District, from I-205 east to the City limit, and from Burnside south to the City lim­its. Some por­tions of this area are ex­cluded from the plan: the Gateway re­gional cen­ter be­cause a street plan al­ready ex­ists, and Burnside light rail sta­tion ar­eas (102&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; to 162&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;,</p>
<p><span class="small-caps">NE</span> Glisan to <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Stark), where mas­ter street plans will be com­pleted as part of <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> re­ﬁne­ment plans.</p>
<p><strong><em>Land Use</em></strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast is pre­dom­i­nantly in res­i­den­tial use, with in­ter­spersed com­mer­cial/​re­tail uses. Commercial/retail uses are lo­cated in strip com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ment along ar­te­ri­als such as 122&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and Division or in malls such as Mall 205 or the San Rafael Shopping Center. Institutions, such as col­leges, hos­pi­tals, and schools, can cre­ate bar­ri­ers, but of­fer lim­ited op­por­tu­ni­ties for street con­nec­tions. Cemeteries and parks also oc­cupy sig­nif­i­cant tracts of land in the dis­trict. There are only a few pock­ets of in­dus­trial uses, prin­ci­pally near the Lents town cen­ter.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zoning</em></strong></p>
<p>The Far Southeast Master Street Plan Study area in­cludes vir­tu­ally all of the var­i­ous City com­mer­cial zones, ex­cept some de­signed specif­i­cally for the Central City. The area in­cludes nearly all the res­i­den­tial zones, ex­clud­ing only the most dense zones. The em­ploy­ment and in­dus­trial zon­ing cur­rently in place is con­ﬁned pri­mar­ily to the south­ern edge of the dis­trict. Signiﬁcant tracts of open space zon­ing ex­ist, with Powell Butte the largest. Environmental over­lays are ap­plied to ar­eas with steep slopes and near streams and wet­land ar­eas, prin­ci­pally in the south­east por­tion of the dis­trict.</p>
<p><strong><em>Area Character</em></strong></p>
<p>Terrain and the den­sity of de­vel­op­ment largely de­ter­mine the area’s char­ac­ter. Some less de­vel­oped ar­eas dis­play a rural ap­pear­ance, with open ﬁelds and large out-build­ings. The ma­jor­ity of the dis­trict has a more sub­ur­ban ap­pear­ance, with large tracts of sin­gle-dwelling homes on medium to large lots. Some ar­eas dis­play a more ur­ban char­ac­ter, with smaller lots and build­ings closer to the street. Steep slopes with nu­mer­ous streams and gul­lies are lo­cated in the south­ern por­tion of the area, along Johnson Creek and in Pleasant Valley.</p>
<p>Long-term county stew­ard­ship, along with re­cent pop­u­la­tion growth, has re­sulted in rel­a­tively few pub­lic streets in some ar­eas, and large re­de­vel­opable parcels of land. Many of the area’s lo­cal ser­vice streets and col­lec­tors are not fully im­proved. The lack of side­walks re­sults in a street sys­tem that is not par­tic­u­larly pedes­trian friendly. The lack of pub­lic streets con­tributes sig­nif­i­cantly to out-of-di­rec­tion travel pat­terns, and very wide ma­jor ar­te­ri­als carry many lo­cal trips as well as through-trips.</p>
<p><strong>Issues and Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Barriers (such as ter­rain, streams, and ex­ist­ing de­vel­op­ment) will con­tinue to limit a con­nected street sys­tem, in­clud­ing bi­cy­cle/​pedes­trian ac­cess­ways, in Far Southeast Portland. With ex­pected in­creases in the num­ber of house­holds and dwelling units in the area, how­ever, com­ple­tion of the lo­cal street sys­tem will be needed even more to pro­vide mul­ti­modal ac­cess to ar­eas of new de­vel­op­ment and from those ar­eas to neigh­bor­hood ac­tiv­ity cen­ters, tran­sit, and ar­te­ri­als.</p>
<p><strong>Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design (2012)</strong></p>
<p>The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation, in co­or­di­na­tion with the Oregon Department of Transportation (<span class="small-caps">ODOT</span>), de­vel­oped a con­cep­tual de­sign plan for Outer <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Powell Blvd. from the I-205 to <span class="small-caps">SE</span> 174th Ave (city lim­its). This stretch of <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Powell Blvd is des­ig­nated State Highway No. 26. Therefore, <span class="small-caps">ODOT</span> has ju­ris­dic­tion along <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Powell Blvd.</p>
<p>The plan ad­dressed the needs for Outer Powell Blvd in a 20-year time frame. The plan iden­ti­ﬁed im­prove­ments and right-of-way width needs that will al­low Outer <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Powell Blvd to serve ve­hi­cle traf­ﬁc move­ment while also im­prov­ing the safety, ac­ces­si­bil­ity and the aes­thetic en­vi­ron­ment for pedes­tri­ans, cy­clists and tran­sit rid­ers. The Outer Powell Blvd Conceptual Plan Design was adopted by Resolution 36931 in February 2013.</p>
<p>A com­po­nent of the plan was im­prov­ing lo­cal con­nec­tiv­ity around Powell Blvd. A Local Streets and Access-ways Report iden­ti­ﬁed ad­di­tional con­nec­tions in the area.</p>
<p>Six types of con­nec­tions were iden­ti­ﬁed in the Local Streets and Accessways Report.</p>
<p>Separated In-Roadway Bicycle Facilities. Facilities that sep­a­rate the bi­cy­cle travel lane from the mo­tor ve­hi­cle lane with strip­ing or a phys­i­cal bar­rier. Examples are a stan­dard bike lane, buffered bike lane, and cy­cle track.</p>
<p>Bicycle Boulevards/Advisory Bike Lanes. Facilities on low traf­ﬁc vol­ume streets where through move­ments of bi­cy­cles is given pri­or­ity over mo­tor ve­hi­cles Advisory bike lanes in­clude dashed bike lane strip­ing and sin­gle mo­tor ve­hi­cle lane. Vehicles are al­lowed to en­ter bike lanes to pass each other.</p>
<p>Pedestrian and Bicycle Pathways. These fa­cil­i­ties are out­side of the road­way right-of way and fully sep­a­rated from the road­way.</p>
<p>Street Connections. New lo­cal streets built to City stan­dards. Sidewalks ac­com­mo­date pedes­trian travel and bike travel share the road­way with ve­hi­cles.</p>
<p>Pedestrian and Bicycle Crossings. Two types of cross­ings were iden­ti­ﬁed. The ﬁrst type is pro­vided by the ex­ist­ing traf­ﬁc sig­nals. New sig­nals were not rec­om­mended. The sec­ond cross­ing type is shown at gen­er­ally de­sired lo­ca­tions be­tween sig­nal­ized in­ter­sec­tions. Speciﬁc de­sign treat­ments were not de­ter­mined (e.g. pedes­trian refuge is­land, <span class="small-caps">HAWK</span> sig­nal, etc.)</p>
<p>Potential Street Realignment. Opportunities to re­align ex­ist­ing streets through fu­ture re­de­vel­op­ment. The ob­jec­tive is to align in­ter­sec­tions on op­po­site sides of Powell Boulevard to im­prove pedes­trian cross­ings or ac­cess to tran­sit stops.</p>
<p><strong>Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan</strong> (Adopted by Resolution No. 37157 October 15, 2015)</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (<span class="small-caps">PBOT</span>), in part­ner­ship with the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and Oregon Department of Transportation (<span class="small-caps">ODOT</span>), de­vel­oped the Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan. The Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan was de­vel­oped to help im­prove lo­cal street and path­way con­nec­tiv­ity in sev­eral East Portland neigh­bor­hoods. The pro­ject area is cen­tered on <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Division Street, a des­ig­nated<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Main Street” in the Metro Region 2040 Growth Concept Plan and the study area was bounded by <span class="small-caps">SE</span> 112th Ave, <span class="small-caps">SE</span> 148th Ave, <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Stark and <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Holgate and in­cludes por­tions of the Hazelwood, Mill Park, Centennial and Powellhurst Gilbert neigh­bor­hoods.</p>
<p>Goals and Objectives: The over­all goal is to de­velop a Neighborhood Street Plan that can bet­ter in­crease street con­nec­tiv­ity and multi-modal travel op­tions within the pro­ject area. Objectives:</p>
<p>● Establish a more con­nected lo­cal street and path net­work</p>
<p>● Create safer walk­ing and bi­cy­cling routes to neigh­bor­hood des­ti­na­tions, tran­sit and the re­gion­ally des­ig­nated <span class="small-caps">SE</span> Division Main Street</p>
<p>● Deﬁne the range of op­tions for im­prov­ing lo­cal streets, in­clud­ing use of Portland Street By Street de­sign op­tions.</p>
<p>● Inform fu­ture im­prove­ments to be built over-time by prop­erty own­ers, de­vel­op­ers and the City.</p>
<p>The Street Plan iden­ti­ﬁed im­ple­men­ta­tion meth­ods for in­tro­duc­ing new street and path­way con­nec­tions and op­tions for im­prov­ing de­ﬁ­cient lo­cal streets. The plan rec­om­mended adding New Future Public Connections across Existing Private Property.</p>

<p><strong>Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</strong></p>
<p>(Adopted by Resolution No. 37162, November 2015)</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (<span class="small-caps">PBOT</span>) and the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (<span class="small-caps">BES</span>) de­vel­oped the Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan to cre­ate a strat­egy to com­plete the trans­porta­tion net­work and stormwa­ter sys­tem within the study area. The Tryon-Stephens plan pro­vides a strat­egy for en­hanc­ing neigh­bor­hood ac­cess to lo­cal des­ti­na­tions by look­ing com­pre­hen­sively at street and drainage is­sues. The Tryon-Stephens Street Plan sets a frame­work for tai­lor­ing im­prove­ments to in­di­vid­ual streets based on the ad­ja­cent land use, street char­ac­ter, and nat­ural set­ting.</p>
<p>The plan rec­om­mends mod­i­fy­ing the City of Portland’s Southwest Master Street Plan (2001) to add fu­ture lo­cal street/​path­way con­nec­tions in two lo­ca­tions within the study area, as shown on the fol­low­ing map (page 52 of the Tryon-Stevens plan). Recommended new con­nec­tions are in the Hillsdale neigh­bor­hood link­ing <span class="small-caps">SW</span> Nevada Court to <span class="small-caps">SW</span> Vermont Street be­tween <span class="small-caps">SW</span> 26th Avenue and Capitol Hill Road, and in the Markham Neighborhood link­ing <span class="small-caps">SW</span> Marigold Street be­tween <span class="small-caps">SW</span> 23rd and <span class="small-caps">SW</span> 26th Avenues.</p>

Prioritize freight sys­tem re­li­a­bil­ity im­prove­ments over sin­gle-oc­cu­pancy ve­hi­cle mo­bil­ity where there are so­lu­tions that dis­tinctly ad­dress those dif­fer­ent needs. <em>Multimodal freight poli­cies are found be­low in poli­cies 9.33 to 9.35.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.8</strong> <strong>Affordability.</strong> Improve and main­tain the trans­porta­tion sys­tem to in­crease ac­cess to con­ve­nient and af­ford­able trans­porta­tion op­tions for all Portlanders, es­pe­cially those who have tra­di­tion­ally been un­der-served or un­der-rep­re­sented or have his­tor­i­cally borne un­equal bur­dens.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.9 Accessible and age-friendly trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</strong> Ensure that trans­porta­tion fa­cil­i­ties are ac­ces­si­ble to peo­ple of all ages and abil­i­ties, and that all im­prove­ments to the trans­porta­tion sys­tem (trafﬁc, tran­sit, bi­cy­cle, and pedes­trian) in the pub­lic right-of-way com­ply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Improve and adapt the trans­porta­tion sys­tem to bet­ter meet the needs of the most vul­ner­a­ble users, in­clud­ing the young, older adults, and peo­ple with dif­fer­ent abil­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.10</strong> <strong>Geographic poli­cies.</strong> Adopt ge­o­graph­i­cally-spe­ciﬁc poli­cies in the Transportation System Plan to en­sure that trans­porta­tion in­fra­struc­ture re­ﬂects the unique topog­ra­phy, his­toric char­ac­ter, nat­ural fea­tures, sys­tem gaps, eco­nomic needs, de­mo­graph­ics, and land uses of each area. Use the Pattern Areas iden­ti­ﬁed in Chapter 3: Urban Form as the ba­sis for area poli­cies.</p>
<h2>Land use, de­vel­op­ment, and place­mak­ing</h2>
<p>Land use pat­terns and con­nec­tions among dif­fer­ent land uses are key el­e­ments deﬁn­ing the form and char­ac­ter of places. In tan­dem with Chapter 3: Urban Form and Chapter 4: Design and Development, the poli­cies in this sec­tion give di­rec­tion for de­sign­ing and build­ing a trans­porta­tion sys­tem that sup­ports, com­ple­ments, and meets the needs of dif­fer­ent places. These poli­cies ac­knowl­edge de­vel­op­ment ad­ja­cent to trans­porta­tion as a crit­i­cal com­po­nent in shap­ing the fu­ture of Portland’s pub­lic spaces and places.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.11 Land use and trans­porta­tion co­or­di­na­tion.</strong> Implement the Comprehensive Plan Map and the Urban Design Framework though co­or­di­nated long-range trans­porta­tion and land use plan­ning. Ensure that street pol­icy and de­sign clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions and land uses com­ple­ment one an­other.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.12 Growth strat­egy.</strong> Use street de­sign and pol­icy clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions to sup­port Goals 3A-3G in Chapter 3: Urban Form. Consider the dif­fer­ent de­sign con­texts and trans­porta­tion func­tions in Town Centers, Neighborhood Centers, Neighborhood Corridors, Employment Areas, Freight Corridors, Civic Corridors, Transit Station Areas, and Greenways.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.13 Development and street de­sign.</strong> Evaluate ad­ja­cent land uses to help in­form street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions in fram­ing, shap­ing, and ac­ti­vat­ing the pub­lic space of streets. Guide de­vel­op­ment and land use to cre­ate the kinds of places and street en­vi­ron­ments in­tended for dif­fer­ent types of streets.</p>
<p><strong>Streets as pub­lic spaces</strong></p>
<p>Streets, in­clud­ing side­walks and plant­ing strips, pro­vide crit­i­cal trans­porta­tion and util­ity func­tions. In Portland, streets are the most abun­dant type of pub­lic space, oc­cu­py­ing nearly 20 per­cent of land area in the city. The fol­low­ing poli­cies sup­port com­mu­nity de­sire to ex­pand the use of streets be­yond their trans­porta­tion func­tions. <em>See Chapter 8: Public Facilities and Services and Chapter 4: Design and Development for fur­ther use and streetscape poli­cies.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.14 Streets for trans­porta­tion and pub­lic spaces.</strong> Integrate both place­mak­ing and trans­porta­tion func­tions when de­sign­ing and man­ag­ing streets by en­cour­ag­ing de­sign, de­vel­op­ment, and op­er­a­tion of streets to en­hance op­por­tu­ni­ties for them to serve as places for com­mu­nity in­ter­ac­tion, en­vi­ron­men­tal func­tion, open space, tree canopy, recre­ation, and other com­mu­nity pur­poses.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.15 Repurposing street space.</strong> Encourage re­pur­pos­ing street seg­ments that are not crit­i­cal for trans­porta­tion con­nec­tiv­ity to other com­mu­nity pur­poses.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.16 Design with na­ture.</strong> Promote street and trail align­ments and de­signs that re­spond to topog­ra­phy and nat­ural fea­tures, when fea­si­ble, and pro­tect streams, wildlife habi­tat, and na­tive trees.</p>
<p><strong>Modal poli­cies</strong></p>
<p>Portland is com­mit­ted to pro­vid­ing a mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion sys­tem that of­fers af­ford­able and con­ve­nient travel op­tions within the city, re­gion, and out­side the Metro area. Because trips are made for dif­fer­ent rea­sons, they vary in length and type of ve­hi­cle (mode) needed to make them. Different modes cre­ate dif­fer­ent kinds of im­pacts — on neigh­bor­hood liv­abil­ity and car­bon emis­sions, for ex­am­ple. These poli­cies rec­og­nize that some modes are more ap­pro­pri­ate than oth­ers for dif­fer­ent types of trips.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.17</strong> <strong>Pedestrian trans­porta­tion</strong>. Encourage walk­ing as the most at­trac­tive mode of trans­porta­tion for most short trips, within neigh­bor­hoods and to cen­ters, cor­ri­dors, and ma­jor des­ti­na­tions, and as a means for ac­cess­ing tran­sit.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.18 Pedestrian net­works.</strong> Create more com­plete net­works of pedes­trian fa­cil­i­ties, and im­prove the qual­ity of the pedes­trian en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.19 Pedestrian safety and ac­ces­si­bil­ity.</strong> Improve pedes­trian safety, ac­ces­si­bil­ity, and con­ve­nience for peo­ple of all ages and abil­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.20 Bicycle trans­porta­tion</strong>. Create con­di­tions that make bi­cy­cling more at­trac­tive than dri­ving for most trips of ap­prox­i­mately three miles or less.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.21 Accessible bi­cy­cle sys­tem.</strong> Create a bi­cy­cle trans­porta­tion sys­tem that is safe, com­fort­able, and ac­ces­si­ble to peo­ple of all ages and abil­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.22</strong> <strong>Public trans­porta­tion</strong>. Coordinate with pub­lic tran­sit agen­cies to cre­ate con­di­tions that make tran­sit the pre­ferred mode of travel for trips that are not made by walk­ing or bi­cy­cling.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.23 Transportation to job cen­ters.</strong> Promote and en­hance tran­sit to be more con­ve­nient and eco­nom­i­cal than the au­to­mo­bile for peo­ple trav­el­ling more than three miles to and from the Central City and Gateway. Enhance re­gional ac­cess to the Central City and ac­cess from Portland to other re­gional job cen­ters.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.24 Transit ser­vice.</strong> In part­ner­ship with TriMet, de­velop a pub­lic trans­porta­tion sys­tem that con­ve­niently, safely, com­fort­ably, and eq­ui­tably serves res­i­dents and work­ers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.25 Transit eq­uity.</strong> In part­ner­ship with TriMet, main­tain and ex­pand high-qual­ity fre­quent tran­sit ser­vice to all Town Centers, Civic Corridors, Neighborhood Centers, Neighborhood Corridors, and other ma­jor con­cen­tra­tions of em­ploy­ment, and im­prove ser­vice to ar­eas with high con­cen­tra­tions of poverty and his­tor­i­cally un­der-served and un­der-rep­re­sented com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.26 Transit fund­ing.</strong> Consider fund­ing strate­gies and part­ner­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties that im­prove ac­cess to and eq­uity in tran­sit ser­vice, such as rais­ing metro-wide fund­ing to im­prove ser­vice and de­crease user fees/​fares.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.27 Transit ser­vice to cen­ters and cor­ri­dors.</strong> Use tran­sit in­vest­ments as a means to shape the city’s growth and in­crease tran­sit use. In part­ner­ship with TriMet and Metro**,** main­tain, ex­pand, and en­hance Portland Streetcar, fre­quent ser­vice bus, and high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit, to bet­ter serve cen­ters and cor­ri­dors with the high­est in­ten­sity of po­ten­tial em­ploy­ment and house­hold growth.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.28</strong> <strong>Intercity pas­sen­ger ser­vice</strong>. Coordinate plan­ning and pro­ject de­vel­op­ment to ex­pand in­ter­city pas­sen­ger trans­porta­tion ser­vices in the Willamette Valley, and from Portland to California, Seattle, and Vancouver, <span class="small-caps">BC</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.29</strong> <strong>Regional traf­ﬁcways and tran­sit­ways</strong>. Maintain ca­pac­ity of re­gional tran­sit­ways and ex­ist­ing re­gional traf­ﬁcways to ac­com­mo­date through-traf­ﬁc.</p>

<p><strong>Policy 9.31</strong> <strong>Economic de­vel­op­ment and in­dus­trial lands.</strong> Ensure that the trans­porta­tion sys­tem sup­ports traded sec­tor eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment plans and full uti­liza­tion of prime in­dus­trial land, in­clud­ing brown­ﬁeld re­de­vel­op­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.32 Multimodal sys­tem and hub.</strong> Maintain Portland’s role as a mul­ti­modal hub for global and re­gional move­ment of goods. Enhance Portland’s net­work of mul­ti­modal freight cor­ri­dors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.33 Freight net­work.</strong> Develop, man­age, and main­tain a safe, ef­ﬁ­cient, and re­li­able freight street net­work to pro­vide freight ac­cess to and from in­ter­modal freight fa­cil­i­ties, in­dus­trial and com­mer­cial dis­tricts, and the re­gional trans­porta­tion sys­tem. Invest to ac­com­mo­date fore­casted growth of in­ter­re­gional freight vol­umes and pro­vide ac­cess to truck, ma­rine, rail, and air trans­porta­tion sys­tems. Ensure des­ig­nated routes and fa­cil­i­ties are ad­e­quate for over-di­men­sional trucks and emer­gency equip­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.34 Sustainable freight sys­tem.</strong> Support the ef­ﬁ­cient de­liv­ery of goods and ser­vices to busi­nesses and neigh­bor­hoods, while also re­duc­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal and neigh­bor­hood im­pacts. Encourage the use of en­ergy ef­ﬁ­cient and clean de­liv­ery ve­hi­cles, and man­age on- and off-street load­ing spaces to en­sure ad­e­quate ac­cess for de­liv­er­ies to busi­nesses, while main­tain­ing ac­cess to homes and busi­nesses.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.35 Freight rail net­work.</strong> Coordinate with stake­hold­ers and re­gional part­ners to sup­port con­tin­ued rein­vest­ment in, and mod­ern­iza­tion of, the freight rail net­work.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.36 Portland Harbor.</strong> Coordinate with the Port of Portland, pri­vate stake­hold­ers, and re­gional part­ners to im­prove and main­tain ac­cess to ma­rine ter­mi­nals and re­lated river-de­pen­dent uses in Portland Harbor.</p>
<p><strong>9.36.a.</strong> Support con­tin­ued rein­vest­ment in, and mod­ern­iza­tion of, ma­rine ter­mi­nals in Portland Harbor.</p>

<p><strong>Policy 9.39 Automobile ef­ﬁ­ciency.</strong> Coordinate land use and trans­porta­tion plans and pro­grams with other pub­lic and pri­vate stake­hold­ers to en­cour­age ve­hi­cle tech­nol­ogy in­no­va­tion, shifts to­ward elec­tric and other cleaner, more en­ergy-ef­ﬁ­cient ve­hi­cles and fu­els, in­te­gra­tion of smart ve­hi­cle tech­nol­ogy with in­tel­li­gent trans­porta­tion sys­tems, and greater use of op­tions such as car-share, car­pool, and taxi.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.40 Emergency re­sponse</strong>. Maintain a net­work of ac­ces­si­ble emer­gency re­sponse streets to fa­cil­i­tate safe and ex­pe­di­ent emer­gency re­sponse and evac­u­a­tion. Ensure that po­lice, ﬁre, am­bu­lance, and other emer­gency providers can reach their des­ti­na­tions in a timely fash­ion, with­out neg­a­tively im­pact­ing traf­ﬁc calm­ing and other mea­sures in­tended to re­duce crashes and im­prove safety.</p>
<p><strong>Airport Futures</strong>
The Port of Portland man­ages the Portland International Airport (<span class="small-caps">PDX</span>) as a re­gional, na­tional, and in­ter­na­tional air trans­porta­tion hub. The Port part­nered with the City of Portland and Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas Counties to pre­pare the Airport Futures Plan (2010) and guide air­port de­vel­op­ment to 2035. Policy di­rec­tion set in this pro­ject in­clude Goal 9.I and the fol­low­ing poli­cies. *Additional air­port-re­lated poli­cies are found in Chapter 4: Design and Development and Chapter 7: Environment and Watershed Health. *</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.41 Portland International Airport.</strong> Maintain the Portland International Airport as an im­por­tant re­gional, na­tional, and in­ter­na­tional trans­porta­tion hub serv­ing the bi-state econ­omy.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.42 Airport reg­u­la­tions.</strong> Implement the Airport Futures Plan through the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Portland International Airport Plan District.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>9.42.a.</strong> Prohibit the de­vel­op­ment of a po­ten­tial third par­al­lel run­way at <span class="small-caps">PDX</span> un­less need for its con­struc­tion is es­tab­lished through a trans­par­ent, thor­ough, and re­gional plan­ning process.</p>
<p><strong>9.42.b.</strong> Support im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Aircraft Landing Zone to pro­vide safer op­er­at­ing con­di­tions for air­craft in the vicin­ity of Portland International Airport by lim­it­ing the height of struc­tures, veg­e­ta­tion, and con­struc­tion equip­ment.</p>
<p><strong>9.42.c.</strong> Support the Port of Portland’s Wildlife Hazard Management Plan by im­ple­ment­ing air­port-spe­ciﬁc land­scap­ing re­quire­ments in the Portland International Airport Plan District to re­duce con­ﬂicts be­tween wildlife and air­craft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Policy 9.43 Airport part­ner­ships.</strong> Partner with the Port of Portland and the re­gional com­mu­nity to ad­dress the crit­i­cal in­ter­con­nec­tion be­tween eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, en­vi­ron­men­tal stew­ard­ship, and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity. Support an on­go­ing pub­lic ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee for <span class="small-caps">PDX</span> to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>9.43.a.</strong> Support mean­ing­ful and col­lab­o­ra­tive pub­lic di­a­logue and en­gage­ment on air­port re­lated plan­ning and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
<p><strong>9.43.b.</strong> Provide an op­por­tu­nity for the com­mu­nity to in­form the de­ci­sion-mak­ing re­lated to the air­port of the Port, the City of Portland, and other ju­ris­dic­tions/​or­ga­ni­za­tions in the re­gion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>9.43.c.</strong> Raise pub­lic knowl­edge about <span class="small-caps">PDX</span> and im­pacted com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.44 Airport in­vest­ments.</strong> Ensure that new de­vel­op­ment and re­de­vel­op­ment of air­port fa­cil­i­ties sup­ports the City’s and the Port’s sus­tain­abil­ity goals and poli­cies, and is in ac­cor­dance with Figure 9-3 — Portland International Airport. Allow the Port ﬂex­i­bil­ity in con­ﬁg­ur­ing air­port fa­cil­i­ties to pre­serve fu­ture de­vel­op­ment op­tions, min­i­mize en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pacts, use land re­sources ef­ﬁ­ciently, max­i­mize op­er­a­tional ef­ﬁ­ciency, en­sure de­vel­op­ment can be ef­fec­tively phased, and ad­dress Federal Aviation Administration’s air­port de­sign cri­te­ria.</p>
<p><strong>System man­age­ment</strong>
Portland’s trans­porta­tion sys­tem is an in­te­grated net­work of roads, rails, trails, side­walks, bi­cy­cle paths, and other fa­cil­i­ties within and through the city. These modal net­works in­ter­sect and are of­ten lo­cated within the same right-of-way. The poli­cies be­low pro­vide di­rec­tion to man­age the sys­tem in ways that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allow dif­fer­ent modes to in­ter­act safely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximize the ca­pac­ity of the ex­ist­ing net­work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify where ad­di­tional ca­pac­ity might be needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Also see Policies 8.37 through 8.49 in Chapter 8: Public Facilities and Services.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.45</strong> <strong>System man­age­ment</strong>. Give pref­er­ence to trans­porta­tion im­prove­ments that use ex­ist­ing road­way ca­pac­ity ef­ﬁ­ciently and that im­prove the safety of the sys­tem for all users.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.46 Trafﬁc man­age­ment</strong>. Evaluate and en­cour­age traf­ﬁc speed and vol­ume to be con­sis­tent with street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions and de­sired land uses to im­prove safety, pre­serve and en­hance neigh­bor­hood liv­abil­ity, and meet sys­tem goals of calm­ing ve­hi­cle traf­ﬁc through a com­bi­na­tion of en­force­ment, en­gi­neer­ing, and ed­u­ca­tion ef­forts.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.47</strong> <strong>Connectivity</strong>. Establish an in­ter­con­nected, mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion sys­tem to serve cen­ters and other sig­nif­i­cant lo­ca­tions. Promote a log­i­cal, di­rect, and con­nected street sys­tem through street spac­ing guide­lines and dis­trict-spe­ciﬁc street plans found in the Transportation System Plan, and pri­or­i­tize ac­cess to spe­ciﬁc places by cer­tain modes in ac­cor­dance with poli­cies 9.6 and 9.7.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.48 Technology.</strong> Encourage the use of emerg­ing ve­hi­cle and park­ing tech­nol­ogy to im­prove real-time man­age­ment of the trans­porta­tion net­work and to man­age and al­lo­cate park­ing sup­ply and de­mand.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.49 Performance mea­sures.</strong> Establish mul­ti­modal per­for­mance mea­sures and mea­sures of sys­tem com­plete­ness to eval­u­ate and mon­i­tor the ad­e­quacy of trans­porta­tion ser­vices based on per­for­mance mea­sures in goals 9.A. through 9.I. Use these mea­sures to eval­u­ate over­all sys­tem per­for­mance, in­form cor­ri­dor and area-spe­ciﬁc plans and in­vest­ments, iden­tify pro­ject and pro­gram needs, eval­u­ate and pri­or­i­tize in­vest­ments, and reg­u­late de­vel­op­ment, in­sti­tu­tional cam­pus growth, zone changes, Comprehensive Plan Map amend­ments, and con­di­tional uses.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.50 Regional con­ges­tion man­age­ment</strong>. Coordinate with Metro to es­tab­lish new re­gional mul­ti­modal mo­bil­ity stan­dards that pri­or­i­tize tran­sit, freight, and sys­tem com­plete­ness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>9.50.a.</strong> Create a re­gional con­ges­tion man­age­ment ap­proach, in­clud­ing a mar­ket-based sys­tem, to price or charge for auto trips and park­ing, bet­ter ac­count for the cost of auto trips, and to more ef­ﬁ­ciently man­age the re­gional sys­tem.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Policy 9.51</strong> <strong>Multimodal Mixed-Use Area.</strong> Designate a Central City Multimodal Mixed-Use Area (<span class="small-caps">MMA</span>) in the ge­og­ra­phy in­di­cated in Figure <span class="small-caps">9‐2</span>, which will ren­der state con­ges­tion / mo­bil­ity stan­dards in­ap­plic­a­ble to pro­posed plan amend­ments un­der <span class="small-caps">OAR</span> 660-0012-0060(10), sub­ject to <span class="small-caps">ODOT</span> con­cur­rence and ex­e­cu­tion of an agree­ment be­tween <span class="small-caps">ODOT</span> and the City of Portland. The agree­ment should em­pha­size po­ten­tial safety and op­er­a­tional im­pacts.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation Demand Management</strong></p>
<p>Providing res­i­dents and em­ploy­ees in­for­ma­tion and in­cen­tives to walk, bi­cy­cle, use tran­sit, and oth­er­wise re­duce the need to own and use pri­vate ve­hi­cles can be one of the quick­est, least ex­pen­sive, and most ef­fec­tive strate­gies to achieve City goals and to pre­vent traf­ﬁc and park­ing im­pacts. Transportation and park­ing de­mand man­age­ment (<span class="small-caps">TDM</span>) pro­grams can cost-ef­fec­tively in­crease the modal share of walk­ing, bi­cy­cling, and shared ve­hi­cle trips.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.52 Outreach</strong>. Create and main­tain <span class="small-caps">TDM</span> out­reach pro­grams that work with Transportation Management Associations (<span class="small-caps">TMA</span>), res­i­dents, em­ploy­ers, and em­ploy­ees that in­crease the modal share of walk­ing, bi­cy­cling, and shared ve­hi­cle trips while re­duc­ing pri­vate ve­hi­cle own­er­ship, park­ing de­mand, and drive-alone trips, es­pe­cially dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.53 New de­vel­op­ment</strong>. Create and main­tain <span class="small-caps">TDM</span> reg­u­la­tions and ser­vices that pre­vent and re­duce traf­ﬁc and park­ing im­pacts from new de­vel­op­ment and re­de­vel­op­ment. Encourage co­or­di­nated area-wide de­liv­ery of <span class="small-caps">TDM</span> pro­grams. Monitor and im­prove the per­for­mance of pri­vate-sec­tor <span class="small-caps">TDM</span> pro­grams.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.54 Projects and pro­grams.</strong> Integrate <span class="small-caps">TDM</span> in­for­ma­tion into trans­porta­tion pro­ject and pro­gram de­vel­op­ment and im­ple­men­ta­tion to in­crease use of new mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion pro­jects and ser­vices.</p>
<p>**Parking man­age­ment
**Vi­brant ur­ban places link peo­ple and ac­tiv­i­ties. As Portland grows, we must man­age both the de­mand and sup­ply of park­ing to achieve cli­mate, health, liv­abil­ity, and pros­per­ity goals. Providing too much and/​or un­der­priced park­ing can lead to more dri­ving and less walk­ing, cy­cling, and tran­sit use; in­ef­ﬁ­cient land use pat­terns; and sprawl. Insufﬁcient park­ing can neg­a­tively af­fect neigh­bor­hood liv­abil­ity and eco­nomic vi­tal­ity. These poli­cies pro­vide guid­ance to man­age park­ing de­mand and sup­ply to meet a va­ri­ety of pub­lic ob­jec­tives, in­clud­ing achiev­ing com­pact walk­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties, re­duc­ing pri­vate ve­hi­cle own­er­ship and over­all ve­hi­cle use, en­hanc­ing liv­abil­ity, re­duc­ing pol­lu­tion, and ex­pand­ing
eco­nomic op­por­tu­nity.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.55 Parking man­age­ment.</strong> Reduce park­ing de­mand and man­age sup­ply to im­prove pedes­trian, bi­cy­cle and tran­sit mode share, neigh­bor­hood liv­abil­ity, safety, busi­ness dis­trict vi­tal­ity, ve­hi­cle miles trav­eled (<span class="small-caps">VMT</span>) re­duc­tion, and air qual­ity. Implement strate­gies that re­duce de­mand for new park­ing and pri­vate ve­hi­cle own­er­ship, and that help main­tain op­ti­mal park­ing oc­cu­pancy and avail­abil­ity.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.56 Curb Zone.</strong> Recognize that the Curb Zone is a pub­lic space, a phys­i­cal and spa­tial as­set that has value and cost. Evaluate whether, when, and where park­ing is the high­est and best use of this pub­lic space in sup­port of broad City pol­icy goals and lo­cal land use con­text. Establish thresh­olds to uti­lize park­ing man­age­ment and pric­ing tools in ar­eas with high park­ing de­mand to en­sure ad­e­quate on-street park­ing sup­ply dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.57 On-street park­ing.</strong> Manage park­ing and load­ing de­mand, sup­ply, and op­er­a­tions in the pub­lic right of way to achieve mode share ob­jec­tives, and to en­cour­age safety, eco­nomic vi­tal­ity, and liv­abil­ity. Use trans­porta­tion de­mand man­age­ment and pric­ing of park­ing in ar­eas with high park­ing de­mand.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.58 Off-street park­ing.</strong> Limit the de­vel­op­ment of new park­ing spaces to achieve land use, trans­porta­tion, and en­vi­ron­men­tal goals, es­pe­cially in lo­ca­tions with fre­quent tran­sit ser­vice. Regulate off-street park­ing to achieve mode share ob­jec­tives, pro­mote com­pact and walk­a­ble ur­ban form, en­cour­age lower rates of car own­er­ship, and pro­mote the vi­tal­ity of com­mer­cial and em­ploy­ment ar­eas. Use trans­porta­tion de­mand man­age­ment and pric­ing of park­ing in ar­eas with high park­ing de­mand. Strive to pro­vide ad­e­quate but not ex­ces­sive off-street park­ing where needed, con­sis­tent with the
pre­ced­ing prac­tices.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.59 Share space and re­sources.</strong> Encourage the shared use of park­ing and ve­hi­cles to max­i­mize the ef­ﬁ­cient use of lim­ited ur­ban space.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9</strong>.<strong>60</strong> <strong>Cost and price.</strong> Recognize the high pub­lic and pri­vate cost of park­ing by en­cour­ag­ing prices that re­ﬂect the cost of pro­vid­ing park­ing and bal­ance de­mand and sup­ply. Discourage em­ployee and res­i­dent park­ing sub­si­dies.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.61 Bicycle park­ing.</strong> Promote the de­vel­op­ment of new bi­cy­cle park­ing fa­cil­i­ties in­clud­ing ded­i­cated bike park­ing in the pub­lic right-of-way. Provide suf­ﬁ­cient bi­cy­cle park­ing at high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit sta­tions to en­hance bi­cy­cle con­nec­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties. Require pro­vi­sion of ad­e­quate off-street bi­cy­cle park­ing for new de­vel­op­ment and re­de­vel­op­ment. Encourage the pro­vi­sion of park­ing for dif­fer­ent types of bi­cy­cles. In es­tab­lish­ing the stan­dards for long-term bi­cy­cle park­ing, con­sider the needs of per­sons with dif­fer­ent lev­els of abil­ity.</p>
<p>**Finance, pro­grams, and co­or­di­na­tion
**Pro­grams and fund­ing are re­quired to build and main­tain the trans­porta­tion sys­tem, and they are nec­es­sary to help de­cide what pro­jects to build. They also pro­vide pub­lic in­for­ma­tion about what fa­cil­i­ties are avail­able and how they can be used. Agencies out­side the City also own and op­er­ate fa­cil­i­ties within Portland and pro­vide fund­ing for new fa­cil­i­ties. These poli­cies ad­dress es­sen­tial fund­ing and co­or­di­na­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties with other agen­cies, as well out­reach and ed­u­ca­tion pro­gram­ming.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.62</strong> <strong>Coordination</strong>. Coordinate with state and fed­eral agen­cies, lo­cal and re­gional gov­ern­ments, spe­cial dis­tricts, other City bu­reaus, and providers of trans­porta­tion ser­vices when plan­ning for, de­vel­op­ing, and fund­ing trans­porta­tion fa­cil­i­ties and ser­vices.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.63</strong> <strong>New de­vel­op­ment im­pacts.</strong> Prevent, re­duce, and mit­i­gate the im­pacts of new de­vel­op­ment and re­de­vel­op­ment on the trans­porta­tion sys­tem. Utilize strate­gies in­clud­ing trans­porta­tion and park­ing de­mand man­age­ment, trans­porta­tion sys­tem analy­sis, and sys­tem and lo­cal im­pact mit­i­ga­tion im­prove­ments and fees.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.64 Education and en­cour­age­ment.</strong> Create, main­tain, and co­or­di­nate ed­u­ca­tional and en­cour­age­ment pro­grams that sup­port mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion and that em­pha­size safety for all modes of trans­porta­tion. Ensure that these pro­grams are ac­ces­si­ble to his­tor­i­cally un­der-served and un­der-rep­re­sented pop­u­la­tions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.65 Telecommuting.</strong> Promote telecom­mut­ing and the use of com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy to re­duce travel de­mand.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.66</strong> <strong>Project and pro­gram se­lec­tion cri­te­ria.</strong> Establish trans­porta­tion pro­ject and pro­gram se­lec­tion cri­te­ria con­sis­tent with goals <span class="small-caps">9A</span> through <span class="small-caps">9I</span>, to cost-ef­fec­tively achieve ac­cess, place­mak­ing, sus­tain­abil­ity, eq­uity, health, pros­per­ity, and safety goals.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 9.67</strong> <strong>Funding.</strong> Encourage the de­vel­op­ment of a range of sta­ble trans­porta­tion fund­ing sources that pro­vide ad­e­quate re­sources to build and main­tain an eq­ui­table and sus­tain­able trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</p>

<p><strong>Policy 8.28 Shared costs</strong>. Ensure the costs of con­struct­ing and pro­vid­ing pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties and ser­vices are eq­ui­tably shared by those who ben­e­ﬁt from the pro­vi­sion of those fa­cil­i­ties and ser­vices.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.29 System de­vel­op­ment</strong>. Require pri­vate or pub­lic en­ti­ties whose prospec­tive de­vel­op­ment or re­de­vel­op­ment ac­tions con­tribute to the need for pub­lic fa­cil­ity im­prove­ments, ex­ten­sions, or con­struc­tion to bear a pro­por­tional share of the costs.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.30</strong> <strong>Partnerships.</strong> Maintain or es­tab­lish pub­lic and pri­vate part­ner­ships for the de­vel­op­ment, man­age­ment, or stew­ard­ship of pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties nec­es­sary to serve des­ig­nated land uses, as ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
<p>**Public ben­e­ﬁts
**The fol­low­ing poli­cies sup­port in­vest­ments to im­prove eq­uity, eco­nomic pros­per­ity, hu­man and wa­ter­shed health, and re­siliency while min­i­miz­ing neg­a­tive im­pacts. They also rec­og­nize that the pub­lic fa­cil­ity and ser­vice needs, and the ap­pro­pri­ate ap­proaches to meet­ing those needs, vary through­out the city. <em>See Chapter 2: Community Involvement</em> for poli­cies re­lated to com­mu­nity en­gage­ment in pub­lic fa­cil­ity de­ci­sions.</p>

<p><strong>Policy 8.34 Resource ef­ﬁ­ciency</strong>. Reduce the en­ergy and re­source use, waste, and car­bon emis­sions from fa­cil­i­ties nec­es­sary to serve des­ig­nated land uses to meet adopted City goals and tar­gets.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.35 Natural sys­tems</strong>. Protect, en­hance, and re­store nat­ural sys­tems and fea­tures for their in­fra­struc­ture ser­vice and other val­ues.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.36 Context-sensitive in­fra­struc­ture</strong>. Design, im­prove, and main­tain pub­lic rights-of-way and fa­cil­i­ties in ways that are com­pat­i­ble with, and that min­i­mize neg­a­tive im­pacts on, their phys­i­cal, en­vi­ron­men­tal, and com­mu­nity con­text.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.37 Site- and area-spe­ciﬁc needs.</strong> Allow for site- and area-spe­ciﬁc pub­lic fa­cil­ity stan­dards, re­quire­ments, tools, and poli­cies as needed to ad­dress dis­tinct topo­graph­i­cal, ge­o­logic, en­vi­ron­men­tal, and other con­di­tions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.38 Age-friendly pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties.</strong> Promote pub­lic fa­cil­ity de­signs that make Portland more age-friendly.</p>
<p>**Public rights-of-way
**The poli­cies in this sec­tion sup­port the role of pub­lic rights-of-way in pro­vid­ing mul­ti­ple pub­lic ser­vices, in­clud­ing mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion ac­cess and move­ment, stormwa­ter man­age­ment, wa­ter dis­tri­b­u­tion, pri­vate util­i­ties, tree canopy, and com­mu­nity use, among oth­ers.

<p>**Trails
**The City of Portland’s trail sys­tem is a key part of both the City’s multi-modal trans­porta­tion sys­tem and its recre­ation sys­tem. Trails within this sys­tem take many dif­fer­ent forms and are lo­cated within the right-of-way and on pub­lic and pri­vate prop­erty. Trails pro­vide Portlanders with lo­cal and re­gional pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle con­nec­tions and ac­cess to many key des­ti­na­tions within the city. They also pro­vide a place to recre­ate and al­low Portlanders to ex­pe­ri­ence the city’s parks and nat­ural ar­eas. Trails play a par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant role in meet­ing pedes­trian and bi­cy­clist mo­bil­ity and con­nec­tiv­ity needs in west­ern neigh­bor­hoods. <em>See Western Neighborhood Pattern Area Policies 3.100 and 3.103</em>. The poli­cies in this sec­tion sup­port con­tin­ued im­prove­ment, man­age­ment, and co­or­di­na­tion of the trail sys­tem.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.53 Public trails.</strong> Establish, im­prove, and main­tain a city­wide sys­tem of lo­cal and re­gional pub­lic trails that pro­vide trans­porta­tion and/​or recre­ation op­tions and are a com­po­nent of larger net­work of fa­cil­i­ties for bi­cy­clists, pedes­tri­ans, and recre­ational users.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.54 Trail sys­tem con­nec­tiv­ity.</strong> Plan, im­prove, and main­tain the city­wide trail sys­tem so that it con­nects and im­proves ac­cess to Portland’s neigh­bor­hoods, com­mer­cial ar­eas, em­ploy­ment cen­ters, schools, parks, nat­ural ar­eas, recre­ational fa­cil­i­ties, re­gional des­ti­na­tions, the re­gional trail sys­tem, and other key places that Portlanders ac­cess in their daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.55 Trail co­or­di­na­tion</strong>. Coordinate plan­ning, de­sign, im­prove­ment, and main­te­nance of the trail sys­tem among City agen­cies, other pub­lic agen­cies, non-gov­ern­men­tal part­ners, and ad­ja­cent landown­ers.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.56 Trail di­ver­sity.</strong> Allow a va­ri­ety of trail types to re­ﬂect a trail’s trans­porta­tion and recre­ation roles, re­quire­ments, and phys­i­cal con­text.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.57 Public ac­cess re­quire­ments</strong>. Require pub­lic ac­cess and im­prove­ment of Major Public Trails as shown in Figure 8-2 — Major Public Trails. Major Public Trails in­clude re­gional trails and other sig­nif­i­cant trail con­nec­tions that pro­vide for the move­ment of pedes­tri­ans, cy­clists, and other users for recre­ation and trans­porta­tion pur­poses**. **</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.58 Trail and City Greenway co­or­di­na­tion.</strong> Coordinate the plan­ning and im­prove­ment of trails as part of the City Greenways sys­tem. <em>See Chapter 3: Urban Form for ad­di­tional poli­cies re­lated to City Greenways.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.59 Trail and Habitat Corridor co­or­di­na­tion.</strong> Coordinate the plan­ning and im­prove­ment of trails with the es­tab­lish­ment, en­hance­ment, preser­va­tion, and ac­cess to habi­tat cor­ri­dors. <em>See Chapter 3: Urban Form for ad­di­tional poli­cies re­lated to Habitat Corridors.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.60 Intertwine co­or­di­na­tion.</strong> Coordinate with the Intertwine Alliance and its part­ners, in­clud­ing lo­cal and re­gional parks providers, to in­te­grate Portland’s trail and ac­tive trans­porta­tion net­work with the bi-state re­gional trail sys­tem.</p>
<p>Sanitary and stormwa­ter sys­tems
The City’s sewer and drainage sys­tem ac­com­mo­dates Portland’s cur­rent and fu­ture needs. It also pro­tects pub­lic health, wa­ter qual­ity, and the en­vi­ron­ment. Using as­set man­age­ment and wa­ter­shed health as goals and guides, the City con­sid­ers the whole wa­ter­shed as an in­ter­con­nected hy­dro­logic sys­tem.</p>
<hr>
<p>The City man­ages san­i­tary sewage through an ex­ten­sive piped col­lec­tion and treat­ment sys­tem, in­clud­ing two waste­water treat­ment plants that dis­charge to the Columbia and Willamette rivers. Stormwater is man­aged and con­veyed through a va­ri­ety of fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing pipes, sumps, sur­face fa­cil­i­ties, and nat­ural drainage­ways. Green in­fra­struc­ture, in­clud­ing land­scaped stormwa­ter fa­cil­i­ties and nat­ural re­sources such as trees and nat­ural ar­eas, is an im­por­tant part of the stormwa­ter sys­tem. Private prop­erty in­vest­ments and pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ships also play key roles in the man­age­ment of stormwa­ter.</p>
<p>The poli­cies be­low en­sure ef­fec­tive san­i­tary and stormwa­ter sys­tems.</p>
<p><strong>Stormwater sys­tem</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.68 Stormwater fa­cil­i­ties</strong>. Provide ad­e­quate stormwa­ter fa­cil­i­ties for con­veyance, ﬂow con­trol, and pol­lu­tion re­duc­tion.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.71 Green in­fra­struc­ture</strong>. Promote the use of green in­fra­struc­ture, such as nat­ural ar­eas, the ur­ban for­est, and land­scaped stormwa­ter fa­cil­i­ties, to man­age stormwa­ter.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.72 Stormwater dis­charge.</strong> Avoid or min­i­mize the im­pact of stormwa­ter dis­charges on the wa­ter and habi­tat qual­ity of rivers and streams.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 8.73 On-site stormwa­ter man­age­ment</strong>. Encourage on-site stormwa­ter man­age­ment, or man­age­ment as close to the source as prac­ti­cal, through land use de­ci­sions and pub­lic fa­cil­ity in­vest­ments.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Urban Form</p>
<p><strong>Citywide Design and Development</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.4 All ages and abil­i­ties.</strong> Strive for a built en­vi­ron­ment that pro­vides a safe, health­ful, and at­trac­tive en­vi­ron­ment for peo­ple of all ages and abil­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Centers</strong></p>
<p>Centers are com­pact and pedes­trian-ori­ented ur­ban places. They are con­nected to pub­lic tran­sit and ac­tive trans­porta­tion net­works. They an­chor com­plete neigh­bor­hoods with re­tail stores and busi­nesses (grocery stores, restau­rants, mar­kets, shops, etc.), civic ameni­ties (libraries, schools, com­mu­nity cen­ters, places of wor­ship, etc.), hous­ing op­tions, health clin­ics, day­care cen­ters, em­ploy­ment cen­ters, plazas and parks, or other pub­lic gath­er­ing places.</p>
<p>Centers will be the pri­mary ar­eas for growth and change in Portland over the next 20 years. Focusing new growth in cen­ters helps achieve goals of hav­ing more Portlanders live in com­plete neigh­bor­hoods, use pub­lic tran­sit and ac­tive trans­porta­tion — walk­ing, bik­ing, and rolling — to com­mute to work and com­plete er­rands, and it will help mit­i­gate and pre­pare for the ef­fects of cli­mate change. Clustering des­ti­na­tions and hous­ing within com­pact, walk­a­ble cen­ters makes ac­cess by tran­sit, walk­ing, wheel­chair, and bi­cy­cle more prac­ti­cal and re­duces the amount of dri­ving needed to ac­cess ser­vices, re­duc­ing the im­pact on road­ways, re­duc­ing con­ges­tion, and helps in fa­cil­i­tat­ing freight move­ment.</p>
<p>Centers range in scale from the Central City’s down­town to small neigh­bor­hood cen­ters, pro­vid­ing lo­cal ac­cess to ser­vices and al­low­ing Portlanders across the city to live a healthy, ac­tive lifestyle. Neighborhood busi­ness dis­tricts and the com­mer­cial ser­vices they pro­vide are the foun­da­tion of many cen­ters, but cen­ters, par­tic­u­larly larger cen­ters, will also be­come a fo­cus for pub­lic ser­vices, gath­er­ing places, and hous­ing growth. In and around all cen­ters, there will be change as ar­eas ur­ban­ize and new ser­vices, shops and hous­ing
are de­vel­oped.</p>
<p>The <span class="small-caps">UDF</span> iden­ti­ﬁes four types of cen­ters that vary in size, scale, ser­vice area, lo­cal ver­sus re­gional role, and den­sity of res­i­dents and busi­nesses. The spe­ciﬁc bound­aries of these cen­ters is shown on the Comprehensive Plan Map.</p>
<p>The four types are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Central City</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regional Center (Gateway)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Town Center</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Center</p>
</li>

<p>Policies in this sec­tion iden­tify es­sen­tial el­e­ments and func­tions of cen­ters that will be en­hanced over time. Additional poli­cies pro­vide more de­tailed di­rec­tion for spe­ciﬁc types of cen­ters based on their scale.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.16 Investments in cen­ters.</strong> Encourage pub­lic and pri­vate in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture, eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, and com­mu­nity ser­vices in cen­ters to en­sure that all cen­ters will sup­port the pop­u­la­tions they serve.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.19 Accessibility.</strong> Design cen­ters to be com­pact, safe, at­trac­tive, and ac­ces­si­ble places, where the street en­vi­ron­ment makes ac­cess by tran­sit, walk­ing, bik­ing, and mo­bil­ity de­vices such as wheel­chairs, safe and at­trac­tive for peo­ple of all ages and abil­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.20 Center con­nec­tions.</strong> Connect cen­ters to each other and to other key lo­cal and re­gional des­ti­na­tions, such as schools, parks, and em­ploy­ment ar­eas, by pedes­trian trails and side­walks, bi­cy­cle shar­ing, bi­cy­cle routes, fre­quent and con­ve­nient tran­sit, and elec­tric ve­hi­cle charg­ing sta­tions. Prepare and adopt fu­ture street plans for cen­ters that cur­rently have poor street con­nec­tiv­ity, es­pe­cially where large com­mer­cial parcels are planned to re­ceive sig­nif­i­cant ad­di­tional hous­ing den­sity.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.21 Green in­fra­struc­ture in cen­ters.</strong> Integrate na­ture and green in­fra­struc­ture into cen­ters and en­hance pub­lic views and con­nec­tions to the sur­round­ing nat­ural fea­tures.</p>
<p>*<em>Central City</em>
***The Central City is a liv­ing lab­o­ra­tory for how the de­sign and func­tion of a dense ur­ban cen­ter can con­cur­rently pro­vide ben­e­ﬁts to hu­man health, the nat­ural en­vi­ron­ment, and the lo­cal econ­omy. As Portland is the ma­jor cen­ter for jobs, tran­sit, ser­vices, and civic and cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions for the en­tire city and re­gion. The Central City houses nu­mer­ous at­trac­tions in­clud­ing Portland State University, the Oregon Convention Center, City Hall, Tom McCall Waterfront Park and the Willamette River, Pioneer Courthouse Square, and many mu­se­ums and venues for artis­tic and cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties and pro­fes­sional sports. The Central City’s ten unique dis­tricts in­clude Downtown, the West End, Goose Hollow, Pearl, Old Town/Chinatown, Lower Albina, Lloyd, the Central Eastside, South Waterfront, and South Downtown/University. Together, these dis­tricts pro­vide a di­ver­sity of op­por­tu­ni­ties for ur­ban liv­ing, eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, re­tail and en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.26 Transportation hub.</strong> Enhance the Central City as the re­gion’s mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion hub and op­ti­mize re­gional ac­cess as well as the move­ment of peo­ple and goods among key des­ti­na­tions.</p>
<p>**Gateway Regional Center
**Gateway Regional Center is East Portland’s ma­jor cen­ter, pro­vid­ing the area and re­gion with civic, em­ploy­ment, and com­mu­nity ser­vices. It in­cludes the city’s largest tran­sit hub out­side of down­town and good free­way ac­cess to re­gional des­ti­na­tions such as Portland International Airport.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.30 Transportation.</strong> Enhance Gateway’s role as a re­gional high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit hub that serves
as an an­chor for East Portland’s mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</p>
<p>**Town Centers
**Town Centers are lo­cated through­out Portland to serve broad parts of the city. They are typ­i­cally an­chored by em­ploy­ment cen­ters or in­sti­tu­tions, fea­ture a wide range of com­mer­cial and com­mu­nity ser­vices, and have a wide range of hous­ing op­tions. Development in Town Centers is in­tended to be up to mid-rise in scale, with larger scale build­ings pri­mar­ily lo­cated close to high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit sta­tions. Mid-rise de­vel­op­ment is typ­i­cally as high as ﬁve to seven sto­ries.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.34 Transportation.</strong> Improve Town Centers as mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion hubs that op­ti­mize ac­cess from the broad area of the city they serve and are linked to the re­gion’s high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit sys­tem.</p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Centers</strong></p>
<p>Neighborhood Centers are smaller, some­times vil­lage-like cen­ters that in­clude a mix­ture of higher den­sity com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial build­ings. Because these cen­ters are smaller than Town Centers, there are many more of them city­wide. Development in Neighborhood Centers is gen­er­ally in­tended to be low-rise in scale, al­though larger scale can be ap­pro­pri­ate in lo­ca­tions close to high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit sta­tions or near the Central City. Low-rise de­vel­op­ment typ­i­cally in­cludes build­ings up to four sto­ries in height.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.38 Transportation.</strong> Design Neighborhood Centers as mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion hubs that are served by fre­quent-ser­vice tran­sit and op­ti­mize pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle ac­cess from ad­ja­cent neigh­bor­hoods.</p>
<p>**Inner Ring Districts **</p>
<p>The Inner Ring Districts in­clude some of Portland’s old­est neigh­bor­hoods, with sev­eral his­toric dis­tricts and a broad di­ver­sity of hous­ing types. These ar­eas in­clude dis­tinct dis­tricts, such as Albina and Northwest Portland, that have mul­ti­ple mixed-use cor­ri­dors in prox­im­ity (<em>see the shaded ar­eas in the Urban Design Framework</em>), al­low­ing most res­i­dents to live within a quar­ter-mile dis­tance of fre­quent-ser­vice tran­sit and neigh­bor­hood busi­nesses. The Inner Ring Districts are also served by a highly in­ter­con­nected sys­tem of streets and side­walks, and are within a three-mile bik­ing dis­tance of the Central City’s ar­ray of ser­vices, jobs, and ameni­ties.</p>
<p>These poli­cies ac­knowl­edge that growth in the Inner Ring Districts plays an im­por­tant role in al­low­ing more peo­ple to have ac­cess to their many op­por­tu­ni­ties, but also ac­knowl­edge that this growth should be in­te­grated into these ar­eas’ his­toric ur­ban fab­ric. The Inner Ring Districts, es­pe­cially along their cor­ri­dors, play a sim­i­lar role to Town Centers in ac­com­mo­dat­ing growth.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3</strong>.<strong>41</strong> <strong>Corridors.</strong> Guide growth in cor­ri­dors to tran­si­tion to mid-rise scale close to the Central City, es­pe­cially along Civic Corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3</strong>.<strong>44 Active trans­porta­tion.</strong> Enhance the role of the Inner Ring Districts’ ex­ten­sive tran­sit, bi­cy­cle, and pedes­trian net­works in con­junc­tion with land uses that op­ti­mize the abil­ity for more peo­ple to uti­lize this net­work. Improve the safety of pedes­trian and bike con­nec­tions to the Central City. Strengthen tran­sit con­nec­tions be­tween the Inner Ring Districts and to the Central City.</p>
<p>**Corridors
**Corridors, like cen­ters, are ar­eas where Portland will grow and change much over the next 20 years. They are busy, ac­tive streets with re­de­vel­op­ment po­ten­tial. They are close to neigh­bor­hoods and are places with tran­sit, stores, hous­ing, and em­ploy­ers. They need to be planned, de­signed, and im­proved to be places that ben­e­ﬁt and be­come suc­cess­ful ad­di­tions to sur­round­ing neigh­bor­hoods. The largest places of fo­cused ac­tiv­ity and den­sity along these cor­ri­dors are des­ig­nated as cen­ters.</p>
<p>There are two types of street cor­ri­dors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Civic Corridors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Corridors</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Policy 3.45 Growth and mo­bil­ity.</strong> Coordinate trans­porta­tion and land use strate­gies along cor­ri­dors to ac­com­mo­date growth and mo­bil­ity needs for peo­ple of all ages and abil­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.46 Connections.</strong> Improve cor­ri­dors as mul­ti­modal con­nec­tions pro­vid­ing tran­sit, pedes­trian, bi­cy­cle, and mo­tor ve­hi­cle ac­cess and that serve the freight needs of cen­ters and neigh­bor­hood busi­ness dis­tricts.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.47 Design.</strong> Encourage street de­sign that bal­ances the im­por­tant trans­porta­tion func­tions of cor­ri­dors with their roles as the set­ting for com­mer­cial ac­tiv­ity and res­i­den­tial liv­ing.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.48 Green in­fra­struc­ture in cor­ri­dors.</strong> Enhance cor­ri­dors with dis­tinc­tive green in­fra­struc­ture, in­clud­ing land­scaped stormwa­ter fa­cil­i­ties, ex­ten­sive tree plant­i­ngs, and other land­scap­ing that both pro­vide en­vi­ron­men­tal func­tion and con­tribute to a qual­ity pedes­trian en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
<p>**Civic Corridors
**Civic Corridors are the city’s busiest, widest, and most promi­nent streets. They pro­vide ma­jor con­nec­tions among cen­ters, the rest of the City, and the re­gion. They sup­port the move­ment of peo­ple and goods across the city, with high lev­els of traf­ﬁc and pedes­trian ac­tiv­ity. Civic Corridors pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth and tran­sit-sup­port­ive den­si­ties of hous­ing, com­merce, and em­ploy­ment. Development in Civic Corridors is in­tended to be up to mid-rise in scale, with lower scale gen­er­ally more ap­pro­pri­ate in lo­ca­tions far from the Central City or tran­sit sta­tions. Mid-rise de­vel­op­ment typ­i­cally ranges from ﬁve to seven sto­ries.</p>
<p>Abundant trees and high-qual­ity land­scap­ing beau­tify Civic Corridors and off­set the im­pacts of their large paved ar­eas. These cor­ri­dors ex­em­plify the ben­e­ﬁts of green in­fra­struc­ture by clean­ing and soak­ing up stormwa­ter runoff and min­i­miz­ing ur­ban heat is­land ef­fects, while also be­ing en­joy­able places to live, work, and gather. Civic cor­ri­dors are safe for all types of trans­porta­tion. Civic Corridors poli­cies ap­ply to the road­way, the pub­lic realm of the street, and the build­ings that line the street.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.49 Integrated land use and mo­bil­ity.</strong> Enhance Civic Corridors as dis­tinc­tive places that are mod­els of eco­log­i­cal ur­ban de­sign, with tran­sit-sup­port­ive den­si­ties of hous­ing and em­ploy­ment, promi­nent street trees and other green fea­tures, and high-qual­ity tran­sit ser­vice and pedes­trian and
bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.50 Design great places.</strong> Improve pub­lic streets and side­walks along Civic Corridors to sup­port the vi­tal­ity of busi­ness dis­tricts, cre­ate dis­tinc­tive places, pro­vide a safe, healthy, and at­trac­tive pedes­trian en­vi­ron­ment, and con­tribute to qual­ity liv­ing en­vi­ron­ments for res­i­dents.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.51 Mobility cor­ri­dors.</strong> Improve Civic Corridors as key mo­bil­ity cor­ri­dors of city­wide im­por­tance that ac­com­mo­date all modes of trans­porta­tion within their right-of-way or on nearby par­al­lel routes.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.52 Freight.</strong> Maintain freight mo­bil­ity and ac­cess on Civic Corridors that are also Major or Priority Truck Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Corridors</strong></p>
<p>Neighborhood Corridors are nar­rower main streets that con­nect neigh­bor­hoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They have trans­porta­tion, land use, and de­sign func­tions that are im­por­tant at a neigh­bor­hood or dis­trict level. They sup­port neigh­bor­hood busi­ness dis­tricts and pro­vide hous­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties close to lo­cal ser­vices, ameni­ties, and tran­sit lines. They are streets that in­clude a mix of com­mer­cial and higher-den­sity hous­ing de­vel­op­ment. This pol­icy is in­tended to bal­ance the im­por­tant trans­porta­tion func­tions of Neighborhood Corridors with their roles in sup­port­ing the vi­a­bil­ity of busi­ness dis­tricts and res­i­den­tial liv­abil­ity.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.53 Neighborhood Corridors.</strong> Enhance Neighborhood Corridors as im­por­tant places that sup­port vi­brant neigh­bor­hood busi­ness dis­tricts with qual­ity multi-fam­ily hous­ing, while pro­vid­ing trans­porta­tion con­nec­tions that link neigh­bor­hoods.</p>
<p><strong>Transit sta­tion ar­eas</strong></p>
<p>Transit sta­tions pro­vide ac­cess to high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit, which cur­rently con­sists of the re­gion’s light rail sys­tem, and in the fu­ture may also in­clude bus rapid tran­sit. These poli­cies en­cour­age hous­ing and em­ploy­ment growth in tran­sit sta­tion ar­eas to max­i­mize peo­ple’s abil­ity to ben­e­ﬁt from the re­gional con­nec­tions they pro­vide and to in­crease tran­sit ac­cess to em­ploy­ment. The poli­cies sup­port a range of tran­sit sta­tion area types, with dif­fer­ing pri­or­i­ties for growth, de­pend­ing on the sta­tion type and con­text.</p>
<p>Priority is given to growth in sta­tion ar­eas lo­cated in cen­ters since they pro­vide more peo­ple with op­por­tu­ni­ties to be close to both tran­sit and to com­mer­cial and pub­lic ser­vices. These sta­tions have the high­est po­ten­tial for mixed use de­vel­op­ment. Center sta­tions ben­e­ﬁt from the con­cen­tra­tion of lo­cal ser­vices and busi­nesses as well as con­nec­tions to other tran­sit routes typ­i­cally found on cor­ri­dors. Mixed-use de­vel­op­ment with hous­ing is not the pri­or­ity for all tran­sit sta­tion ar­eas; some are lo­ca­tions for em­ploy­ment, or they serve ma­jor re­gional des­ti­na­tions such as the Oregon Zoo. <em>See Figure 3-4 — Transit Station Areas.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.54 Transit-oriented de­vel­op­ment.</strong> Encourage tran­sit-ori­ented de­vel­op­ment and tran­sit-sup­port­ive con­cen­tra­tions of hous­ing and jobs, and mul­ti­modal con­nec­tions at and ad­ja­cent to high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit sta­tions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.55 Community con­nec­tions.</strong> Integrate tran­sit sta­tions into sur­round­ing com­mu­ni­ties and en­hance pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties (including bike shar­ing) to pro­vide safe and ac­ces­si­ble con­nec­tions to key des­ti­na­tions be­yond the sta­tion area.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.56 Transit sta­tion area safety.</strong> Design tran­sit ar­eas to im­prove pedes­trian, bi­cy­cle, and per­sonal safety.</p>
<p><strong>City Greenways</strong></p>
<p>City Greenways are a sys­tem of dis­tinc­tive pedes­trian- and bi­cy­cle-friendly streets and trails, en­hanced by lush tree canopy and land­scaped stormwa­ter fa­cil­i­ties that sup­port ac­tive liv­ing by ex­pand­ing trans­porta­tion and recre­ational op­por­tu­ni­ties and mak­ing it eas­ier and more at­trac­tive to reach des­ti­na­tions across the city. As Portland con­tin­ues to grow, the City Greenways sys­tem will strengthen con­nec­tions to na­ture, weave green el­e­ments into neigh­bor­hoods, and en­hance mo­bil­ity and recre­ation.</p>
<p>City Greenways are a net­work that in­cludes the fol­low­ing types of in­fra­struc­ture:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enhanced green­way cor­ri­dors are dis­tinc­tive streets with ex­ten­sive tree canopy and land­scaped stormwa­ter fa­cil­i­ties that pro­vide con­nec­tions be­tween ma­jor cen­ters, schools, parks, nat­ural ar­eas, and the rivers. Enhanced green­way cor­ri­dors of­ten in­volve im­prove­ments to ex­ist­ing streets, in­clud­ing wide plant­ing strips and other fea­tures that pro­vide space for large-canopy trees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trails are des­ig­nated routes on land or wa­ter that pro­vide pub­lic ac­cess for recre­ation or trans­porta­tion pur­poses, such as walk­ing and bi­cy­cling. They are of­ten lo­cated along rivers, through nat­ural ar­eas, or along rail or high­way rights-of-way, with con­nec­tions to and through neigh­bor­hoods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heritage park­ways are iconic streets or seg­ments of streets with el­e­ments such as lin­ear park­ways, scenic views, and dis­tinc­tive land­scap­ing or street de­sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood green­ways are an ex­ten­sive net­work of streets with low vol­umes of mo­tor ve­hi­cle traf­ﬁc that are pri­or­i­tized for bi­cy­cles and en­hance the pedes­trian en­vi­ron­ment, work­ing in con­junc­tion with the rest of the City Greenways sys­tem to ex­tend the sys­tem into all neigh­bor­hoods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>See Figure 3-5&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;City Greenways.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.61 Connections.</strong> Create a net­work of dis­tinc­tive and at­trac­tive City Greenways that link cen­ters, parks, schools, rivers, nat­ural ar­eas, and other key com­mu­nity des­ti­na­tions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.62 Integrated sys­tem.</strong> Create an in­te­grated City Greenways sys­tem that in­cludes re­gional trails through nat­ural ar­eas and along Portland’s rivers, con­nected to neigh­bor­hood green­ways, and her­itage park­ways.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.63 Multiple ben­e­ﬁts.</strong> Design City Greenways that pro­vide mul­ti­ple ben­e­ﬁts that con­tribute to Portland’s pedes­trian, bi­cy­cle, green in­fra­struc­ture, and parks and open space sys­tems.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.64 Design.</strong> Use de­sign op­tions such as dis­tinc­tive street de­sign, mo­tor ve­hi­cle di­ver­sion, land­scap­ing, tree plant­i­ngs, scenic views, and other ap­pro­pri­ate de­sign op­tions, to cre­ate City Greenways that ex­tend the ex­pe­ri­ence of open spaces and na­ture into neigh­bor­hoods, while im­prov­ing stormwa­ter man­age­ment and calm­ing traf­ﬁc.</p>
<p><em>Additional poli­cies re­lated to City Greenways are pro­vided in Chapter 9: Transportation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Employment ar­eas</strong></p>
<p>Portland is a ma­jor em­ploy­ment cen­ter in the re­gion and the state. The di­ver­sity of the econ­omy is spread evenly among four types of busi­ness sec­tors that thrive in dif­fer­ent parts of the city: in­dus­trial, of­ﬁce, in­sti­tu­tional, and re­tail/​ser­vice. The city’s em­ploy­ment ge­o­gra­phies are:</p>
<p><strong>Central City:</strong> The Central City is the re­gion’s high-den­sity em­ploy­ment cen­ter. It is pri­mar­ily an of­ﬁce dis­trict for pro­fes­sional and busi­ness ser­vices, ﬁ­nance, in­for­ma­tion, soft­ware, and gov­ern­ment. It is also a key lo­ca­tion for the en­ter­tain­ment, small in­dus­try, and
ed­u­ca­tion sec­tors.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Districts:</strong> Industrial dis­tricts are in the low, ﬂat ar­eas along Portland Harbor and the Columbia Corridor, Oregon’s freight in­fra­struc­ture hub. Manufacturing and dis­tri­b­u­tion sec­tors con­cen­trate here. They typ­i­cally need one-story build­ings, medium to large sites, and lo­ca­tions buffered from hous­ing. There is also an in­dus­trial dis­trict in the Central Eastside and smaller in­dus­trial ar­eas scat­tered around the city, mostly ad­ja­cent to ma­jor trans­porta­tion hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Commercial</strong>: Neighborhood Commercial ar­eas are mainly home to the re­tail, per­sonal ser­vice, and re­lated sec­tors that serve cus­tomers on-site. These busi­nesses lo­cate amid their mar­ket ar­eas, lin­ing cor­ri­dors across the city. They gen­er­ally need ground-ﬂoor space along pedes­trian or auto-ori­ented streets.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Institutions:</strong> Institutions in the health care and ed­u­ca­tion sec­tors are con­cen­trated in large hos­pi­tal and col­lege cam­puses and dis­persed smaller fa­cil­i­ties. Major in­sti­tu­tions are large em­ploy­ers with cam­puses that vary from pas­toral ex­panses to more con­cen­trated ur­ban grounds. They are lo­cated through­out the city, of­ten in or ad­ja­cent to
res­i­den­tial ar­eas.</p>
<p>Each of these sec­tors is grow­ing, and each has dif­fer­ent land use needs and of­fers dif­fer­ent pros­per­ity ben­e­ﬁts. Traded sec­tor (export) busi­nesses bring in­come and jobs into the re­gion and are mainly in the in­dus­trial and of­ﬁce sec­tors. Middle-wage jobs that re­quire less col­lege ed­u­ca­tion and of­fer up­ward mo­bil­ity are con­cen­trated in the in­dus­trial sec­tors. Ofﬁce jobs of­fer a wide va­ri­ety of wages and are mainly con­cen­trated in the Central City but are also dis­trib­uted in neigh­bor­hood busi­ness dis­tricts.</p>
<p>Retail and ser­vice sec­tor jobs are con­cen­trated in the Central City and neigh­bor­hood busi­ness dis­tricts. They pro­vide needed ser­vices to res­i­dents and in­clude many lo­cally-owned busi­nesses; they do not typ­i­cally of­fer higher-pay­ing em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. The health care and ed­u­ca­tion sec­tors are the lead­ing job growth op­por­tu­ni­ties, most of which are lo­cated on ma­jor cam­puses. Healthcare is one of the city’s fastest grow­ing
em­ploy­ment sec­tors.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Truck Corridors:</strong> Maintaining the pri­mary truck routes into and through the city sup­ports Portland’s role as an im­por­tant West Coast hub and a gate­way for in­ter­na­tional and do­mes­tic trade. These streets are in­te­gral to the growth of traded sec­tor busi­nesses such as man­u­fac­tur­ing, ware­hous­ing and dis­tri­b­u­tion in­dus­tries.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3</strong>.<strong>69</strong> <strong>Regional Truck Corridors.</strong> Enhance des­ig­nated streets to ac­com­mo­date fore­cast freight growth and sup­port in­ten­si­ﬁed in­dus­trial use in nearby freight dis­tricts. <em>See Figure 3-7 — Employment Areas.</em> Designated re­gional truck­ways and pri­or­ity truck streets (Transportation System Plan clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions are shown to il­lus­trate this net­work).</p>
<p>**Pattern Areas
**Portland has ﬁve dis­tinct Pattern Areas. The de­vel­op­ment pat­terns and char­ac­ter­is­tics of these ar­eas are in­ﬂu­enced by the nat­ural land­scape and how and when these parts of the city were de­vel­oped.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rivers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Central City</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inner Neighborhoods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Western Neighborhoods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eastern Neighborhoods</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each Pattern Area has unique phys­i­cal, so­cial, cul­tural, and en­vi­ron­men­tal qual­i­ties that dif­fer­en­ti­ate them and cre­ate their sense of place. To main­tain and en­hance the pos­i­tive qual­i­ties and sense of place in each pat­tern area, it is de­sir­able to have poli­cies and reg­u­la­tions that re­spond to each area’s unique nat­ural and built as­sets.</p>
<p>The fol­low­ing poli­cies iden­tify key pos­i­tive char­ac­ter­is­tics of each of Portland’s Pattern Areas that are rel­e­vant to de­ci­sions re­lated to fu­ture de­vel­op­ment in these ar­eas. Area and neigh­bor­hood plans should be con­sulted for more de­tailed guid­ance on de­sign pri­or­i­ties in dif­fer­ent parts of the city.</p>
<p>**Rivers Pattern Area
**Human set­tle­ment be­gan along and at the con­ﬂu­ence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers be­cause it of­fered Native Americans plen­ti­ful food, nat­ural re­sources, and crit­i­cally-im­por­tant trade and trans­porta­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties. After white im­mi­grants be­gan mov­ing to the area, the set­tle­ment grew into the city of Portland. As the city’s ini­tial form-giv­ing fea­tures, the two rivers have con­tin­ued to shape the city.</p>
<p>Today, the Willamette and Columbia rivers con­tinue to serve mul­ti­ple func­tions and roles.</p>
<p>The rivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are fea­tures of sig­nif­i­cant his­toric and cul­tural sig­nif­i­cance to Native American tribes and oth­ers through­out the re­gion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve as es­sen­tial in­dus­trial trans­porta­tion cor­ri­dors that sup­port the lo­cal and re­gional econ­omy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support recre­ational, sub­sis­tence, and com­mer­cial ﬁsh­eries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide im­por­tant habi­tat for res­i­dent and mi­gra­tory ﬁsh and wildlife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are im­por­tant scenic, recre­ational, and trans­porta­tion ameni­ties for Portlanders
and vis­i­tors.</p>

<p>These poli­cies fos­ter de­vel­op­ment and land stew­ard­ship ap­proaches that rec­og­nize, sup­port, and bal­ance the var­ied sys­tems, uses, and ac­tiv­i­ties along the Columbia and Willamette rivers, in­clud­ing: the Portland Harbor, Columbia Corridor, and other prime in­dus­trial lands; habi­tat ar­eas and cor­ri­dors; dis­tinc­tive river­front neigh­bor­hoods along the banks; and ac­cess to, along, and within the rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.71 River trans­porta­tion.</strong> Recognize and en­hance the roles of the Willamette and Columbia rivers as part of Portland’s his­toric, cur­rent, and fu­ture trans­porta­tion in­fra­struc­ture, in­clud­ing for freight, com­merce, com­mut­ing, and other pub­lic and pri­vate trans­porta­tion func­tions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.73 Industry and port fa­cil­i­ties.</strong> Enhance the re­gion­ally sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic in­fra­struc­ture that in­cludes Oregon’s largest sea­port and largest air­port, unique mul­ti­modal freight, rail, and har­bor ac­cess; the re­gion’s crit­i­cal en­ergy hub; and prox­im­ity to an­chor man­u­fac­tur­ing and
dis­tri­b­u­tion fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.77 River ac­cess.</strong> Enhance and com­plete Portland’s sys­tem of river ac­cess points and river­side trails, in­clud­ing the Willamette Greenway Trail, and strengthen ac­tive trans­porta­tion con­nec­tions be­tween neigh­bor­hoods and the rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.83 Willamette River Greenway.</strong> Maintain multi-ob­jec­tive plans and reg­u­la­tions to guide de­vel­op­ment, in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments, and nat­ural re­source pro­tec­tion and en­hance­ment within and along the Willamette Greenway.</p>
<p>**Central City Pattern Area
**The Central City is home to Portland’s great­est con­cen­tra­tions of em­ploy­ment, and civic, cul­tural, and higher ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tions. Primary nat­ural fea­tures in­clude the Willamette River, large street trees, green streets and land­scap­ing, and cor­ri­dors of park blocks that fur­ther weave na­ture into the Central City. The area’s high-den­sity mixed-use neigh­bor­hoods con­tribute to the dis­tinct iden­ti­ties of dif­fer­ent ar­eas within the Central City. These poli­cies high­light some key de­sign pri­or­i­ties for the Central City re­lated to its dis­tinc­tive ur­ban form. These poli­cies en­cour­age de­sign in the Central City that en­hances its role as the re­gion’s cen­ter of in­no­va­tion and ex­change, in recog­ni­tion that a healthy city must have a healthy core.</p>
<p><em>Additional poli­cies re­lated to the de­sign of the Central City are pro­vided in the Centers sec­tion of this chap­ter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.86 Central City pedes­trian sys­tem.</strong> Maintain and ex­pand the Central City’s highly in­ter­con­nected pedes­trian sys­tem.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.87</strong> <strong>Central City bi­cy­cle sys­tem.</strong> Expand and im­prove the Central City’s bi­cy­cle sys­tem.</p>
<p>**Inner Neighborhoods Pattern Area
**The Inner Neighborhoods were de­vel­oped and shaped dur­ing the Streetcar Era of the late 19th and early 20th cen­turies. The Inner Neighborhoods are char­ac­ter­ized by a reg­u­lar pat­tern of neigh­bor­hood busi­ness dis­tricts lo­cated along for­mer street­car streets in­ter­spersed with res­i­den­tial ar­eas. This Pattern Area has a small block pat­tern with an in­ter­con­nected street grid that make tran­sit, walk­ing, and bi­cy­cling at­trac­tive op­tions. Within this Pattern Area is an in­ner ring of neigh­bor­hoods that pro­vide im­por­tant op­por­tu­ni­ties for ad­di­tional hous­ing close to the Central City, but where fu­ture growth should be in­te­grated into the ex­ist­ing and his­toric con­text. <em>See the Inner Ring Districts sec­tion in this chap­ter</em>. These poli­cies ex­press the over­all de­sign ap­proach in Inner Neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.88 Inner Neighborhoods main streets.</strong> Maintain and en­hance the Streetcar Era pat­tern of street-ori­ented build­ings along Civic and Neighborhood cor­ri­dors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.89 Inner Neighborhoods street pat­terns.</strong> Preserve the area’s ur­ban fab­ric of com­pact blocks and its highly in­ter­con­nected grid of streets.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.91 Inner Neighborhoods ac­tive trans­porta­tion.</strong> Use the ex­ten­sive street, side­walk, and bike­way sys­tem and mul­ti­ple con­nec­tions to the Central City as a key part of Portland’s ac­tive trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.92 Inner Neighborhoods res­i­den­tial ar­eas.</strong> Continue the pat­terns of small, con­nected blocks, reg­u­lar lot pat­terns, and streets lined by plant­ing strips and street trees in Inner Neighborhood res­i­den­tial ar­eas.</p>
<p>**Eastern Neighborhoods Pattern Area
**Portland’s Eastern Neighborhoods fea­ture a di­verse range of ur­ban and nat­ural land­scapes. Many struc­tures in the Eastern Neighborhoods, which also in­clude parts of Brentwood-Darlington and Cully, were de­vel­oped af­ter World War <span class="small-caps">II</span>. In ad­di­tion, most of this this area was an­nexed into the City of Portland af­ter the 1980 Comprehensive Plan was com­pleted. The poli­cies for the Eastern Neighborhoods pro­mote de­sign that re­sponds to and en­hances the area’s dis­tinc­tive mix of ur­ban pat­terns and nat­ural fea­tures, such as groves of Douglas ﬁrs, the East Buttes, and streams. Some poli­cies ad­dress the op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges pre­sented by the area’s large blocks, deep lots, gaps in pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle con­nec­tiv­ity, and wide street cor­ri­dors.</p>
<p>The Eastern Neighborhoods pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for new and dis­tinc­tive ap­proaches to the de­sign of de­vel­op­ment and in­fra­struc­ture that can en­hance the area’s pos­i­tive char­ac­ter­is­tics and im­prove qual­ity of life. It is im­por­tant to con­tinue the area’s ver­dant char­ac­ter and pro­vide a more liv­able en­vi­ron­ment, while re­duc­ing dis­par­i­ties and in­creas­ing ac­cess to ser­vices.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.93 Eastern Neighborhoods street, block, and lot pat­tern.</strong> Guide the evolv­ing street and block sys­tem in the Eastern Neighborhoods in ways that build on pos­i­tive as­pects of the area’s large blocks, such as op­por­tu­ni­ties to con­tinue mid-block open space pat­terns and cre­ate new con­nec­tions through blocks that make it eas­ier to ac­cess com­mu­nity des­ti­na­tions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.94 Eastern Neighborhoods site de­vel­op­ment.</strong> Require that land be ag­gre­gated into larger sites be­fore land di­vi­sions and other re­de­vel­op­ment oc­curs. Require site plans which ad­vance de­sign and street con­nec­tiv­ity goals.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.95 Eastern Neighborhoods trees and nat­ural fea­tures.</strong> Encourage de­vel­op­ment and right-of-way de­sign that pre­serves and in­cor­po­rates Douglas ﬁr trees and groves, and that pro­tects the area’s streams, forests, wet­lands, steep slopes, and buttes.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.97 Eastern Neighborhoods cor­ri­dor land­scap­ing.</strong> Encourage land­scaped build­ing set­backs along res­i­den­tial cor­ri­dors on ma­jor streets.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.98 Eastern Neighborhoods ac­tive trans­porta­tion.</strong> Enhance ac­cess to cen­ters, em­ploy­ment ar­eas, and other com­mu­nity des­ti­na­tions in Eastern Neighborhoods by en­sur­ing that cor­ri­dors have safe and ac­ces­si­ble pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties and cre­at­ing ad­di­tional sec­ondary con­nec­tions that pro­vide low-stress pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle ac­cess.</p>
<p>**Western Neighborhoods Pattern Area
**The Western Neighborhoods have been shaped by their lo­ca­tion within the ter­rain of Portland’s west hills. Much of this area was de­vel­oped af­ter World War <span class="small-caps">II</span>. These poli­cies en­cour­age de­sign that re­sponds to the area’s promi­nent char­ac­ter­is­tics, such as its hilly topog­ra­phy, streams, ravines, and forested slopes, while cul­ti­vat­ing a built en­vi­ron­ment that ex­pands mo­bil­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity for all peo­ple. These de­sign ap­proaches are in­tended to ap­ply to a range of de­vel­op­ment types and lo­ca­tions.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.100 Western Neighborhoods ac­tive trans­porta­tion.</strong> Provide safe and ac­ces­si­ble pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle con­nec­tions, as well as off-street trail con­nec­tions, to and from res­i­den­tial neigh­bor­hoods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 3.103 Western Neighborhoods trails.</strong> Develop pedes­trian-ori­ented con­nec­tions and en­hance the Western Neighborhoods’ dis­tinc­tive sys­tem of trails to in­crease safety, ex­pand mo­bil­ity, ac­cess to na­ture, and ac­tive liv­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Design and Development Policies (Comp Plan Chapter 4)</strong></p>
<p>Portland’s neigh­bor­hoods have dis­tinct char­ac­ter­is­tics and street en­vi­ron­ments that pro­vide a sense of place and that are a set­ting for pub­lic life. The fol­low­ing poli­cies guide build­ing and site de­sign to re­spond to pos­i­tive char­ac­ter­is­tics of their con­text and pro­mote ac­ces­si­ble and at­trac­tive pub­lic en­vi­ron­ments. They also sup­port de­sign­ing de­vel­op­ment to con­tribute to the qual­ity of the pub­lic realm of streets and other open spaces, and en­cour­age the in­te­gra­tion of nat­ural el­e­ments into the built en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.1 Pattern ar­eas.</strong> Encourage build­ing and site de­signs that re­spect the unique built nat­ural, his­toric, and cul­tural char­ac­ter­is­tics of Portland’s ﬁve pat­tern ar­eas de­scribed in Chapter 3: Urban Form.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.2 Community iden­tity.</strong> Encourage the de­vel­op­ment of char­ac­ter-giv­ing de­sign fea­tures that are re­spon­sive to place and the cul­tures of com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.3 Site and con­text.</strong> Encourage de­vel­op­ment that re­sponds to and en­hances the pos­i­tive qual­i­ties of site and con­text — the neigh­bor­hood, the block, the pub­lic realm, and nat­ural fea­tures.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.4 Natural fea­tures and green in­fra­struc­ture.</strong> Integrate nat­ural and green in­fra­struc­ture such as trees, green spaces, eco­roofs, gar­dens, green walls, and veg­e­tated stormwa­ter man­age­ment sys­tems, into the ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment. Encourage stormwa­ter fa­cil­i­ties that are de­signed to be a func­tional and at­trac­tive el­e­ment of pub­lic spaces, es­pe­cially in cen­ters and cor­ri­dors.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.5 Pedestrian-oriented de­sign.</strong> Enhance the pedes­trian ex­pe­ri­ence through­out Portland through pub­lic and pri­vate de­vel­op­ment that cre­ates ac­ces­si­ble, safe, and at­trac­tive places for all those who walk and/​or use wheel­chairs or other mo­bil­ity de­vices.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.6 Street ori­en­ta­tion.</strong> Promote build­ing and site de­signs that en­hance the pedes­trian ex­pe­ri­ence with win­dows, en­trances, path­ways, and other fea­tures that pro­vide con­nec­tions to the street en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.7 Development and pub­lic spaces.</strong> Guide de­vel­op­ment to help cre­ate high-qual­ity pub­lic places and street en­vi­ron­ments while con­sid­er­ing the role of ad­ja­cent de­vel­op­ment in fram­ing, shap­ing, and ac­ti­vat­ing the pub­lic space of streets and ur­ban parks.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.8 Alleys.</strong> Encourage the con­tin­ued use of al­leys for park­ing ac­cess, while pre­serv­ing pedes­trian ac­cess. Expand the num­ber of al­ley-fac­ing ac­ces­sory dwelling units.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.9 Transitional ur­ban­ism.</strong> Encourage tem­po­rary ac­tiv­i­ties and struc­tures in places that are tran­si­tion­ing to ur­ban ar­eas to pro­mote job cre­ation, en­tre­pre­neur­ship, ac­tive streets, and hu­man in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
<p>**Design and de­vel­op­ment of cen­ters and cor­ri­dors
**Cen­ters and cor­ri­dors are places where large num­bers of peo­ple live, work, and visit. Careful at­ten­tion to the de­sign of cen­ters and cor­ri­dors is nec­es­sary to en­sure that they be­come places where peo­ple want to live and gather, and where get­ting around by walk­ing, bik­ing, or wheel­chair is an at­trac­tive choice. These poli­cies also en­cour­age the de­vel­op­ment of cen­ters as places that re­ﬂect the char­ac­ter and cul­tures of the sur­round­ing neigh­bor­hoods.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.20 Walkable scale.</strong> Focus ser­vices and higher-den­sity hous­ing in the core of cen­ters to sup­port a crit­i­cal mass of de­mand for com­mer­cial ser­vices and more walk­a­ble ac­cess for cus­tomers.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.21 Street en­vi­ron­ment.</strong> Encourage de­vel­op­ment in cen­ters and cor­ri­dors to in­clude ameni­ties that cre­ate a pedes­trian-ori­ented en­vi­ron­ment and pro­vide places for peo­ple to sit, spend time, and gather.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.22 Relationship be­tween build­ing height and street size.</strong> Encourage de­vel­op­ment in cen­ters and cor­ri­dors that is re­spon­sive to street space width, thus al­low­ing taller build­ings on wider streets.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.23 Design for pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle ac­cess.</strong> Provide ac­ces­si­ble side­walks, high-qual­ity bi­cy­cle ac­cess, and fre­quent street con­nec­tions and cross­ings in cen­ters and cor­ri­dors.</p>
<p>**Designing with na­ture
**In­cor­po­rat­ing nat­ural fea­tures and func­tions into de­vel­op­ment im­proves hu­man and eco­log­i­cal health, yield­ing tan­gi­ble so­cial, en­vi­ron­men­tal, and eco­nomic ben­e­ﬁts. Designing with na­ture pro­vides or en­hances ecosys­tem ser­vices, such as stormwa­ter man­age­ment, cool­ing of air and wa­ter, re­duc­tion of land­slide, wild­ﬁre and ﬂood­ing risks, pro­tec­tion or en­hance­ment of ﬁsh and wildlife habi­tat, and op­por­tu­ni­ties for Portlanders to en­joy na­ture in their daily lives. These poli­cies ap­ply to a broad range of land uses and de­vel­op­ment sites, en­cour­ag­ing de­vel­op­ment de­signed to en­hance the iden­tity and beauty of Portland’s neigh­bor­hoods, busi­ness dis­tricts, and in­dus­trial dis­tricts, while im­prov­ing wa­ter­shed health and re­silience to cli­mate change.</p>
<p><em>Additional goals and poli­cies about the in­te­gra­tion of na­ture into the built en­vi­ron­ment and in­fra­struc­ture are found in Chapter 7: Environment and Watershed Health, Chapter 8: Public Facilities and Services, and Chapter 9: Transportation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.73 Design with na­ture.</strong> Encourage de­sign and site de­vel­op­ment prac­tices that en­hance, and avoid the degra­da­tion of, wa­ter­shed health and ecosys­tem ser­vices and that in­cor­po­rate trees and veg­e­ta­tion.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.74 Flexible de­vel­op­ment op­tions.</strong> Encourage ﬂex­i­bil­ity in the di­vi­sion of land, the sit­ing and de­sign of build­ings, and other im­prove­ments to re­duce the im­pact of de­vel­op­ment on en­vi­ron­men­tally-sen­si­tive ar­eas and to re­tain healthy na­tive and ben­e­ﬁ­cial veg­e­ta­tion and trees.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.75 Low-impact de­vel­op­ment and best prac­tices.</strong> Encourage use of low-im­pact de­vel­op­ment, habi­tat-friendly de­vel­op­ment, bird-friendly de­sign, and green in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
<p><strong>Policy 4.76 Impervious sur­faces.</strong> Limit use of and strive to re­duce im­per­vi­ous sur­faces and as­so­ci­ated im­pacts on hy­dro­logic func­tion, air and wa­ter qual­ity, habi­tat con­nec­tiv­ity, tree canopy, and ur­ban heat is­land ef­fects.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Portland is pro­jected to add 140,000 new jobs and 260,000 new res­i­dents over the next 20 years. As Portland and the re­gion grow, how­ever, there is a con­tin­u­ing chal­lenge to main­tain the nat­ural en­vi­ron­ment, eco­nomic pros­per­ity, and over­all qual­ity of life. If in 2035 the per­cent­age of peo­ple who drive alone to work re­mains near 60% as is was in 2015, traf­ﬁc, car­bon emis­sions, and house­hold spend­ing on ve­hi­cles and fuel will all worsen sig­nif­i­cantly. In or­der to ac­com­mo­date this growth, our trans­porta­tion sys­tem must pro­vide Portlanders safer and more con­ve­nient ways to walk, bike, and take tran­sit for more trips. The Transportation System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide trans­porta­tion poli­cies and in­vest­ments in Portland. The 2035 Transportation System Plan guides in­vest­ments to main­tain and im­prove the liv­abil­ity of Portland by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>sav­ing lives and re­duc­ing in­juries to all peo­ple us­ing our trans­porta­tion sys­tem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lim­it­ing traf­ﬁc con­ges­tion so tran­sit and freight ve­hi­cles can move more re­li­ably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re­duc­ing car­bon emis­sions and pro­mot­ing healthy lifestyles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep­ing more money in the lo­cal econ­omy, as we spend less on ve­hi­cles and fuel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cre­at­ing great places</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> meets state and re­gional plan­ning re­quire­ments and ad­dresses lo­cal trans­porta­tion needs. Transportation plan­ning that pro­motes ac­tive trans­porta­tion modes is es­sen­tial to pre­serv­ing the City’s liv­abil­ity and for the pro­tec­tion of the nat­ural en­vi­ron­ment Constructing sig­nif­i­cant amounts of new au­to­mo­bile ca­pac­ity to ac­com­mo­date growth is not a de­sir­able op­tion be­cause of the enor­mous costs and im­pacts. Adding more streets and park­ing lots di­vides neigh­bor­hoods, uses valu­able land, en­cour­ages ur­ban sprawl, and has neg­a­tive en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pacts. Alternative ap­proaches, sup­port­ing a safer, more af­ford­able and more com­plete mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion net­work must be used to en­sure in­te­grated, com­pre­hen­sive so­lu­tions. The ﬁrst <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> was adopted by Council in 2002 (Ordinance 177028).</p>
<p>The Transportation System Plan helps im­ple­ment the City’s 2035 Comprehensive Plan in ad­di­tion to the re­gion’s 2040 Growth Concept by sup­port­ing a trans­porta­tion sys­tem that makes it more con­ve­nient for peo­ple to walk, bi­cy­cle, use tran­sit, and drive less to meet their daily needs. The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> also rec­og­nizes that the trans­porta­tion sys­tem must help grow and sus­tain the City’s eco­nomic health by ac­com­mo­dat­ing the needs of busi­nesses and sup­port­ing Portland’s role in the in­ter­na­tional econ­omy.</p>
<h2>Why is this im­por­tant?</h2>
<p>The trans­porta­tion sys­tem is es­sen­tial to the func­tion­ing of the city and the well-be­ing and pros­per­ity of the com­mu­nity. It con­nects peo­ple and busi­nesses to goods and ser­vices, and links them to the re­gion, state, na­tion, and world. Although trans­porta­tion is of­ten mea­sured in terms of mo­bil­ity, it also cre­ates ac­cess to op­por­tu­nity. The way we build our city has an im­pact on our mo­bil­ity and, by ex­ten­sion, our ac­cess to op­por­tu­nity. These goals and poli­cies also re­ﬂect the role of trans­porta­tion plan­ning in re­duc­ing car­bon emis­sions and im­prov­ing pub­lic health. Finally, this chap­ter ac­knowl­edges the role that streets can play in pro­vid­ing great civic and recre­ational spaces.</p>
<p>With its 1980 Comprehensive Plan, the City of Portland be­came a na­tional leader in the in­te­gra­tion of land use and trans­porta­tion. The 2035 Comprehensive Plan builds on that tra­di­tion and adds new in­no­va­tions. The goals and poli­cies in this chap­ter in­crease the fo­cus on com­plete mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion sys­tems. The his­tor­i­cal em­pha­sis on au­to­mo­bile mo­bil­ity in­creas­ingly cre­ates a cost bur­den on house­holds and the com­mu­nity as a whole. For the city to suc­cess­fully meet its trans­porta­tion sys­tem goals for the fu­ture, other more af­ford­able choices must be widely avail­able and safe.</p>
<h2>What is the Transportation System Plan?</h2>
<p>The Transportation System Plan (<span class="small-caps">TSP</span>) is the 20-year plan to guide trans­porta­tion in­vest­ments in Portland. The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> meets state and re­gional plan­ning re­quire­ments and ad­dresses lo­cal trans­porta­tion needs. It in­cludes:</p>
<ol>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Elements of the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> — the poli­cies, the pro­jects in­cluded in the List of Signiﬁcant Projects, street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion maps, and street plan maps — are adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan. The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> it­self is adopted con­cur­rently with the Comprehensive Plan but is pub­lished un­der a sep­a­rate cover. For ease of use and trans­parency, the city­wide poli­cies from the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> are also in­cluded in this chap­ter of the Comprehensive Plan.</p>
<p>The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> also pro­vides more de­tail than the Comprehensive Plan by in­clud­ing ad­di­tional sub-poli­cies and area-spe­ciﬁc poli­cies, and ad­di­tional sup­port­ing in­for­ma­tion about trans­porta­tion sys­tem con­di­tions. The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> con­tains the trans­porta­tion el­e­ment of the City’s Public Facilities Plan.

<p>The goals and poli­cies, street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion de­scrip­tions and maps, the ﬁ­nan­cial plan and the mas­ter street plan maps in the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> are adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan, but pub­lished un­der a sep­a­rate cover.</p>
<p>For ease of use and trans­parency, trans­porta­tion re­lated poli­cies from the 2035 Comprehensive Plan (2015) in Chapter 9 (Transportation), Chapter 3 (Urban Design), Chapter 4 (Development) and Chapter 8 (Public Facilities) are in­cluded in the Reference Section (Appendix A). The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> also in­cludes ad­di­tional sub-poli­cies, ge­o­graphic -speciﬁc poli­cies, and ob­jec­tives.**</p>
<p>The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> is both an im­ple­men­ta­tion tool and a sup­port­ing doc­u­ment to the Comprehensive Plan. It con­tains the trans­porta­tion el­e­ment of the City’s Public Facilities Plan, and the List of Signiﬁcant Projects and Citywide Programs. The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> also pro­vides more de­tail than the Comprehensive Plan by in­clud­ing ad­di­tional sup­port­ing in­for­ma­tion about trans­porta­tion sys­tem con­di­tions.</p>
<h2>Transportation System Plan Updates</h2>
<p>In or­der to keep the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> cur­rent and up-to-date with re­cent trans­porta­tion plan­ning and de­vel­op­ment ac­tiv­i­ties, it is up­dated at reg­u­lar in­ter­vals. The ﬁrst two up­dates were not in­tended to in­clude new pol­icy ini­tia­tives. They were pri­mar­ily tech­ni­cal in na­ture and in­cluded cor­rec­tions, up­dates to pro­ject de­scrip­tions, up­dates on stud­ies, and in­clu­sion of new mas­ter street plans adopted as a part of plan­ning ef­forts.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst up­date was com­pleted and adopted by City Council on October 13, 2004 (effective date, November 12, 2004; Ordinance Nos. 178815 and 178826).</p>
<p>The sec­ond up­date was com­pleted and adopted by City Council on April 5, 2007 (effective date, May 5, 2007; Ordinance No 180871). While pri­mar­ily tech­ni­cal in na­ture, this up­date also in­cluded new pol­icy lan­guage to im­ple­ment the City’s Green Street Policy.</p>
<p>The Stage 2 up­date is a part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan up­date and changes were made to im­ple­ment the Comp Plan, as well as re­ﬂect adopted plans and clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion changes since the last up­date in 2007. The Stage 3 of the up­date (2016) will in­cor­po­rate re­gional in­for­ma­tion, up­date ge­o­graphic poli­cies and ob­jec­tives, ad­di­tional street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion changes, modal plans, other changes as iden­ti­ﬁed, and re­for­mat the doc­u­ment.</p>
<h2><span class="small-caps">REGULATORY</span> <span class="small-caps">FRAMEWORK</span></h2>
<p>The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> ad­dresses and com­plies with a num­ber of State and re­gional goals, poli­cies, and reg­u­la­tions, as sum­ma­rized be­low.</p>
<h3>State of Oregon</h3>
<h4>Statewide Planning Goals</h4>
<p>Oregon has 19 goals that pro­vide a foun­da­tion for the State’s land use plan­ning pro­gram. The <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> must com­ply with all ap­plic­a­ble State goals. The two goals di­rectly ap­plic­a­ble to the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> are Goal 11: Public Facilities Plan and Goal 12: Transportation.</p>
<h4>Transportation Planning Rule</h4>
<p>The Transportation Planning Rule (<span class="small-caps">TPR</span>) im­ple­ments statewide plan­ning Goal 12: Transportation. The <span class="small-caps">TPR</span> re­quires State, re­gional, and lo­cal ju­ris­dic­tions to de­velop Transportation System Plans (TSPs) that com­ply with <span class="small-caps">TPR</span> pro­vi­sions. These pro­vi­sions in­clude re­duc­ing ve­hi­cle miles trav­eled (<span class="small-caps">VMT</span>) per capita by 10 per­cent over the next 20 years, re­duc­ing park­ing spaces per capita, and im­prov­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for al­ter­na­tives to the au­to­mo­bile.</p>
<h4>Oregon Transportation Plan</h4>
<p>The Oregon Transportation Plan (<span class="small-caps">OTP</span>) serves as the State’s <span class="small-caps">TSP</span>. Regional and lo­cal TSPs must be con­sis­tent with the <span class="small-caps">OTP</span>.</p>
<h3>Regional Metro</h3>
<h4>Regional Transportation Plan</h4>
<p>First adopted by Metro in 1983, with lat­est up­date in 2014, the Regional Transportation Plan (<span class="small-caps">RTP</span>) serves as the re­gional <span class="small-caps">TSP</span>. As such, the <span class="small-caps">RTP</span>:</p>
<p>Is con­sis­tent with the re­quire­ments of the State <span class="small-caps">TPR</span> and <span class="small-caps">OTP</span></p>
<p>Implements the 2040 Growth Concept and Regional Framework Plan</p>
<p>Focuses on the re­gional trans­porta­tion sys­tem</p>
<p>Includes mul­ti­modal func­tional clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions and street de­sign clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions</p>
<p>Includes a list of ma­jor sys­tem im­prove­ments</p>
<p>Includes a fund­ing plan</p>
<h4>Region 2040 Growth Concept</h4>
<p>Metro adopted the 2040 Growth Concept as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. The 2040 Growth Concept stated the pre­ferred form of long-term re­gional growth and de­vel­op­ment, in­clud­ing the ur­ban growth bound­ary (<span class="small-caps">UGB</span>), den­sity, and open space pro­tec­tion. It also des­ig­nates de­sign types, such as cen­tral city, re­gional cen­ter, town cen­ter, and main street.</p>
<h4>Regional Transportation Functional Plan</h4>
<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (ﬁrst adopted in 2010, last up­dated in 2012; Ordinance No 10-1241B) im­ple­ments the Goals and Objectives in sec­tion 2.3 of the <span class="small-caps">RTP</span> and the poli­cies of the <span class="small-caps">RTP</span>, and re­places the re­gional park­ing pol­icy of the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (See <span class="small-caps">RTFP</span> Title 4: Regional Parking Management.) It pro­vides pol­icy ba­sis and di­rec­tion for lo­cal TSPs. The <span class="small-caps">RTFP</span> cod­i­ﬁes re­quire­ments that lo­cal plans must com­ply with to be con­sis­tent with the Regional Transportation Plan. Therefore, its re­quire­ments are bind­ing on cities and coun­ties.</p>
<h4>Urban Growth Management Functional Plan</h4>
<p>Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (<span class="small-caps">UGMFP</span>) in 1996 and up­dated it 2014 to im­ple­ment re­gional goals and ob­jec­tives adopted by the Metro Council as the Regional Growth Goals and Objectives (<span class="small-caps">RUGGO</span>), in­clud­ing the 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework Plan. The <span class="small-caps">UGMFP</span> ad­dresses the ac­com­mo­da­tion of re­gional pop­u­la­tion and job growth. Its re­quire­ments are bind­ing on cities and coun­ties.</p>
<h4>Regional Framework Plan</h4>
<p>The Regional Framework Plan, adopted in 1997, iden­ti­ﬁes re­gional poli­cies to im­ple­ment the 2040 Growth Concept, pre­serv­ing ac­cess to na­ture and build­ing great com­mu­ni­ties for to­day and the fu­ture. The plan was amended in 2005 and 2010, and again in 2014 as part of the adop­tion of the Climate Smart Strategy.</p>
<h3>City of Portland</h3>
<h4>Comprehensive Plan</h4>
<p>Portland’s 2035 Comprehensive Plan guides land use de­vel­op­ment and pub­lic fa­cil­ity in­vest­ment de­ci­sions be­tween now and 2035. This guid­ance is in­tended to help make Portland more pros­per­ous, healthy, eq­ui­table and re­silient.</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Plan in­cludes ﬁve el­e­ments that work to­gether to ac­com­plish this goal:</p>
<p>Vision and Guiding Principles</p>
<p>Goals and Policies</p>
<p>Comprehensive Plan Map</p>
<p>List of Signiﬁcant Projects</p>
<p>Transportation poli­cies, clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions and mas­ter street plans</p>
<p>The goals and poli­cies in the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> con­vey the City’s in­tent to:</p>
<p>Create a co­or­di­nated, ef­ﬁ­cient, and more af­ford­able mul­ti­modal trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</p>
<p>Make cost-ef­fec­tive in­vest­ments and sys­tem-man­age­ment de­ci­sions that en­cour­age peo­ple to choose healthy, ac­tive, and low-car­bon trans­porta­tion modes and sys­tems, and en­hance the eco­nomic com­pet­i­tive­ness of the re­gion.</p>
<p>Reduce ser­vice dis­par­i­ties and achieve eq­ui­table ac­cess to all types of fa­cil­i­ties and trans­porta­tion modes.</p>
<p>Ensure safety for users of all trans­porta­tion modes, with at­ten­tion to the most vul­ner­a­ble users, in­clud­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, those us­ing mo­bil­ity de­vices, the young, and the el­derly.</p>
<p>Guide the lo­ca­tion and de­sign of new street, pedes­trian, bi­cy­cle, and trail in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
<p>Direct how and when trans­porta­tion in­fra­struc­ture is man­aged and main­tained.</p>
<p>Provide pol­icy guid­ance for de­vel­op­ing and im­ple­ment­ing the Transportation System Plan.</p>
<p>Within the Comprehensive Plan and <span class="small-caps">TSP</span>, there are nine Transportation goals:</p>
<p>Safety</p>
<p>Multiple goals</p>
<p>Great places</p>
<p>Environmentally sus­tain­able</p>
<p>Equitable trans­porta­tion</p>
<p>Positive health out­comes</p>
<p>Opportunities for pros­per­ity</p>
<p>Cost ef­fec­tive­ness</p>
<p>Airport fu­tures</p>

<h2><span class="small-caps">SEVEN</span> <span class="small-caps">OUTCOMES</span></h2>
<p>Working with our part­ners at Metro, Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, and the Oregon Department of Transportation, with di­rec­tion from the Portland Plan (2012), the Climate Action Plan (2010), Health Equity &amp; the Transportation System Plan Report (2012), and from the Comprehensive Plan Update, Portland Bureau of Transportation (<span class="small-caps">PBOT</span>) staff de­vel­oped an out­comes based ap­proach to the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span>.</p>
<p>These seven out­comes di­rected pol­icy choices as well as in­formed the de­vel­op­ment of cri­te­ria for se­lect­ing and pri­or­i­tiz­ing <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> Projects and Programs. The Transportation System Improvements Chapter con­tains de­tails on the city­wide pro­ject and pro­grams process and eval­u­a­tion.</p>
<p>These seven out­comes are:</p>
<p>Improve ac­cess to daily needs, such as jobs, schools, gro­cery stores, and health care</p>
<p>Reduce/eliminate trans­porta­tion fa­tal­i­ties and in­juries</p>
<p>Improve health by in­creas­ing walk­ing and bi­cy­cling</p>
<p>Increase eco­nomic ben­e­ﬁts, such as ac­cess to fam­ily wage jobs and freight ac­cess</p>
<p>Ensure dis­ad­van­taged com­mu­ni­ties ben­e­ﬁt as much or more than non-dis­ad­van­taged com­mu­ni­ties</p>
<p>Reduce global warm­ing pol­lu­tion from trans­porta­tion</p>
<p>Prioritize the most cost-ef­fec­tive pro­jects</p>
<h1><strong>Transportation Objectives</strong></h1>
<p>The ob­jec­tives con­tained within the <span class="small-caps">TSP</span> of­fer fur­ther de­tails to sup­port the Comp Plan Goals and Policies. Objectives are spe­ciﬁc state­ments that im­ple­ment, and help as­sess in­cre­men­tal progress to­wards, the goals and poli­cies.

<p><strong>Objective 9.2 Street Classiﬁcation Descriptions (formerly Objective 6.4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.2.a.</strong> Classiﬁcation de­scrip­tions and des­ig­na­tions are used to de­ter­mine the ap­pro­pri­ate­ness of street im­prove­ments and to make rec­om­men­da­tions on new and ex­pand­ing land uses through the land use re­view processes.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.b.</strong> Classiﬁcation de­scrip­tions are used to de­scribe how streets should func­tion for each mode of travel, not nec­es­sar­ily how they are func­tion­ing at pre­sent.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.c.</strong> All of a street’s clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions must be con­sid­ered in de­sign­ing street im­prove­ments and al­lo­cat­ing fund­ing. While a pro­posed pro­ject may serve only one clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion, im­prove­ments should not pre­clude fu­ture mod­i­ﬁ­ca­tions to ac­com­mo­date other clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions of the street.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.d.</strong> When the ex­ist­ing use of a street does not com­ply with its clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion, no ad­di­tional in­vest­ments should be made that en­cour­age that in­ap­pro­pri­ate use.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.e.</strong> Designate new streets within a land di­vi­sion site as Local Service Streets for all modes un­less oth­er­wise des­ig­nated through a con­cur­rent or sub­se­quent Comprehensive Plan amend­ment to the Transportation Element.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.f.</strong> Designate new streets within Pedestrian Districts and Freight Districts as Local Service Streets un­less oth­er­wise des­ig­nated through a Comprehensive Plan amend­ment to the Transportation Element.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 9.3 Trafﬁc Classiﬁcation Descriptions (formerly Objective 6.5)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.3.a.</strong> <strong>Regional Trafﬁcways</strong> serve in­ter­re­gional dis­trict move­ment that has only one trip end in a trans­porta­tion dis­trict or to serve trips that by­pass a dis­trict com­pletely.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Regional Trafﬁcways should serve the Central City, re­gional cen­ters, in­dus­trial ar­eas, and in­ter­modal fa­cil­i­ties and should con­nect key freight routes within the re­gion to points out­side the re­gion. Encourage pri­vate and pub­lic de­vel­op­ment of re­gional sig­nif­i­cance to lo­cate ad­ja­cent to Regional Trafﬁcway in­ter­changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Regional Trafﬁcways should con­nect to other Regional Trafﬁcways, Major City Trafﬁc Streets, and District Collectors. A ramp that con­nects to a Regional Trafﬁcway is clas­si­ﬁed as a Regional Trafﬁcway from its point of con­nec­tion up to its in­ter­sec­tion with a lower-clas­si­ﬁed street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffering. Adjacent neigh­bor­hoods should be buffered from the im­pacts of Regional Trafﬁcways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Classiﬁcation. A street with dual Regional Trafﬁcway and Major City Trafﬁc Street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions should re­tain the op­er­a­tional char­ac­ter­is­tics of a Major City Trafﬁc Street and re­spond to ad­ja­cent land uses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.b.</strong> <strong>Major City Trafﬁc Streets</strong> serve as the prin­ci­pal routes for traf­ﬁc that has at least one trip end within a trans­porta­tion dis­trict.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Major City Trafﬁc Streets should pro­vide mo­tor ve­hi­cle con­nec­tions among the Central City, re­gional cen­ters, town cen­ters, in­dus­trial ar­eas, and in­ter­modal fa­cil­i­ties. Auto-oriented de­vel­op­ment should lo­cate ad­ja­cent to Major City Trafﬁc Streets, but should ori­ent to pedes­tri­ans along streets also clas­si­ﬁed as Transit Streets or within Pedestrian Districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Major City Trafﬁc Streets should serve as pri­mary con­nec­tions to Regional Trafﬁcways and serve ma­jor ac­tiv­ity cen­ters in each dis­trict. Trafﬁc with no trip ends within a trans­porta­tion dis­trict should be dis­cour­aged from us­ing Major City Trafﬁc Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-Street Parking. On-street park­ing may be re­moved and ad­di­tional right-of-way pur­chased to pro­vide ad­e­quate traf­ﬁc ac­cess when con­sis­tent with the street de­sign des­ig­na­tion of the street. Evaluate the need for on-street park­ing to serve ad­ja­cent land uses and im­prove the safety of pedes­tri­ans and bi­cy­clists when mak­ing changes to the road­way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.c.</strong> <strong>Trafﬁc Access Streets</strong> pro­vide ac­cess to Central City des­ti­na­tions, dis­trib­ute traf­ﬁc within a Central City dis­trict, pro­vide con­nec­tions be­tween Central City dis­tricts, and dis­trib­ute traf­ﬁc from Regional Trafﬁcways and Major City Trafﬁc Streets for ac­cess within the dis­trict. Trafﬁc Access Streets are not in­tended for through-traf­ﬁc with no trip ends in the dis­trict.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Trafﬁc Access Streets serve Central City land uses. Solutions to con­ges­tion prob­lems on Trafﬁc Access Streets must ac­com­mo­date the high-den­sity pat­tern de­sired in the Central City.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Connections to ad­join­ing trans­porta­tion dis­tricts should be to District or Neighborhood Collectors. Intersections of Trafﬁc Access Streets and streets with higher or sim­i­lar clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions should be sig­nal­ized, where war­ranted, to fa­cil­i­tate the safe move­ment of traf­ﬁc along each street as well as turn­ing move­ments from one street to the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access. Reduction in mo­tor ve­hi­cle con­ges­tion is given less pri­or­ity than: sup­port­ing pedes­trian ac­cess and en­hanc­ing the pedes­trian en­vi­ron­ment; main­tain­ing on-street park­ing to sup­port land uses; ac­com­mo­dat­ing tran­sit; or ac­com­mo­dat­ing bi­cy­cles. Access to off-street park­ing is al­lowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-of-way Acquisition. Acquisition of ad­di­tional right-of-way to re­duce con­ges­tion is dis­cour­aged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.d.</strong> <strong>District Collectors</strong> serve as dis­trib­u­tors of traf­ﬁc from Major City Trafﬁc Streets to streets of the same or lower clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion. District Collectors serve trips that both start and end within a dis­trict.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. District Collectors gen­er­ally con­nect town cen­ters, cor­ri­dors, main streets, and neigh­bor­hoods to nearby re­gional cen­ters and other ma­jor des­ti­na­tions. Land uses that at­tract trips from the sur­round­ing neigh­bor­hoods or from through­out the dis­trict should be en­cour­aged to lo­cate on District Collectors. Regional at­trac­tors of traf­ﬁc should be dis­cour­aged from lo­cat­ing on District Collectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. District Collectors should con­nect to Major City Trafﬁc Streets, other col­lec­tors, and lo­cal streets and, where nec­es­sary, to Regional Trafﬁcways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-Street Parking. Removal of on-street park­ing and right-of-way ac­qui­si­tion should be dis­cour­aged on District Collectors, ex­cept at spe­ciﬁc prob­lem lo­ca­tions to ac­com­mo­date the equally im­por­tant func­tions of traf­ﬁc move­ment and ve­hi­cle ac­cess to abut­ting prop­er­ties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.e.</strong> <strong>Neighborhood Collectors</strong> serve as dis­trib­u­tors of traf­ﬁc from Major City Trafﬁc Streets or District Collectors to Local Service Streets and to serve trips that both start and end within ar­eas bounded by Major City Trafﬁc Streets and District Collectors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Neighborhood Collectors should con­nect neigh­bor­hoods to nearby cen­ters, cor­ri­dors, sta­tion com­mu­ni­ties, main streets, and other nearby des­ti­na­tions. New land uses and ma­jor ex­pan­sions of land uses that at­tract a sig­nif­i­cant vol­ume of traf­ﬁc from out­side the neigh­bor­hood should be dis­cour­aged from lo­cat­ing on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Neighborhood Collectors should con­nect to Major City Trafﬁc Streets, District Collectors, and other Neighborhood Collectors, as well as to Local Service Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. The de­sign of Neighborhood Collectors may vary over their length as the land use char­ac­ter changes from pri­mar­ily com­mer­cial to pri­mar­ily res­i­den­tial. Some Neighborhood Collectors may have a re­gional func­tion, ei­ther alone or in con­cert with other nearby par­al­lel col­lec­tors. All Neighborhood Collectors should be de­signed to op­er­ate as neigh­bor­hood streets rather than as re­gional ar­te­ri­als.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-Street Parking. The re­moval of on-street park­ing and right-of-way ac­qui­si­tion should be dis­cour­aged on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.3.f.</strong> <strong>Local Service Trafﬁc Streets</strong> dis­trib­ute lo­cal traf­ﬁc and pro­vide ac­cess to lo­cal res­i­dences or com­mer­cial uses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use/Development. Discourage auto-ori­ented land uses from us­ing Local Service Trafﬁc Streets as their pri­mary ac­cess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classiﬁcation. Streets not clas­si­ﬁed as Regional Trafﬁcways, Major City Trafﬁc Streets, District Collectors, or Neighborhood Collectors are clas­si­ﬁed as Local Service Trafﬁc Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. Local Service Trafﬁc Streets should con­nect neigh­bor­hoods, pro­vide lo­cal cir­cu­la­tion, and pro­vide ac­cess to nearby cen­ters, cor­ri­dors, sta­tion ar­eas, and main streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Local Service Trafﬁc Streets pro­vide lo­cal cir­cu­la­tion for traf­ﬁc, pedes­tri­ans, and bi­cy­clists and (except in spe­cial cir­cum­stances) should pro­vide on-street park­ing. In some in­stances, where ve­hi­cle speeds and vol­umes are very low (for ex­am­ple, woon­erfs and ac­cess­ways), Local Service Trafﬁc Streets may ac­com­mo­date both ve­hi­cles and pedes­tri­ans and bi­cy­clists in a shared space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective 9.4 Transit Classiﬁcation Descriptions (formerly Objective 6.6)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.4.a.</strong> <strong>Regional Transitways</strong> pro­vide for in­ter­re­gional and in­ter­dis­trict tran­sit trips with fre­quent, high speed, high-ca­pac­ity, ex­press, or lim­ited ser­vice, and to con­nect the Central City with all re­gional cen­ters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Development with a re­gional at­trac­tion (e.g., shop­ping cen­ters, are­nas) are en­cour­aged to lo­cate ad­ja­cent to Regional Transitways to re­duce traf­ﬁc im­pacts on ad­join­ing ar­eas and streets. Locate high-den­sity de­vel­op­ment within a half-mile of tran­sit sta­tions on Regional Transitways, with the high­est den­si­ties clos­est to the sta­tions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Transit. Transit sta­tions should be de­signed to ac­com­mo­date a high level of mul­ti­modal ac­cess within a half-mile ra­dius of the sta­tion. Use feeder bus ser­vice to ac­cess Regional Transit sta­tions. Use park-and-ride fa­cil­i­ties to ac­cess Regional Transit sta­tions only at ends of Regional Transitways or where ad­e­quate feeder bus ser­vice is not fea­si­ble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Use tran­sit-pref­er­en­tial treat­ments to fa­cil­i­tate light rail and bus op­er­a­tions. Consider the use of ac­cess man­age­ment mea­sures to re­duce con­ﬂicts be­tween tran­sit ve­hi­cles and other ve­hi­cles. Where com­pat­i­ble with ad­ja­cent land uses, right-of-way ac­qui­si­tion or park­ing re­moval may oc­cur to ac­com­mo­date tran­sit-pref­er­en­tial mea­sures and im­prove ac­cess to tran­sit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer Points. Provide safe and con­ve­nient trans­fer points with cov­ered wait­ing ar­eas with tran­sit route in­for­ma­tion, benches, trash re­cep­ta­cles, en­hanced sign­ing, light­ing, and tele­phones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus Stops. Buses pro­vid­ing lo­cal ser­vice along Regional Transitways should have more fre­quent stop spac­ing, sim­i­lar to stop spac­ing along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Classiﬁcation. A street with a dual Regional Transitway and Major Transit Priority Street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions should re­tain the op­er­a­tional char­ac­ter­is­tics of a Major Transit Priority Street and re­spond to ad­ja­cent land uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. A ramp that con­nects to a Regional Transitway is clas­si­ﬁed as a Regional Transitway up to its in­ter­sec­tion with a lower-clas­si­ﬁed street.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.b. Major Transit Priority Streets</strong> pro­vide for high-qual­ity tran­sit ser­vice that con­nects the Central City and other re­gional and town cen­ters and main streets.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Transit-oriented land uses should be en­cour­aged to lo­cate along Major Transit Priority Streets, es­pe­cially in cen­ters. Discourage auto-ori­ented de­vel­op­ment from lo­cat­ing on a Major Transit Priority Street, ex­cept where the street is out­side the Central City, re­gional or town cen­ter, sta­tion com­mu­nity, or main street and is also clas­si­ﬁed as a Major City Trafﬁc Street. Support land use den­si­ties that vary di­rectly with the ex­ist­ing and planned ca­pac­ity of tran­sit ser­vice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Transit. Provide safe and con­ve­nient ac­cess for pedes­tri­ans and bi­cy­clists to, across, and along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Employ tran­sit-pref­er­en­tial mea­sures, such as sig­nal pri­or­ity and by­pass lanes. Where com­pat­i­ble with ad­ja­cent land use des­ig­na­tions, right-of-way ac­qui­si­tion or park­ing re­moval may oc­cur to ac­com­mo­date tran­sit-pref­er­en­tial mea­sures or im­prove ac­cess to tran­sit. The use of ac­cess man­age­ment should be con­sid­ered where needed to re­duce con­ﬂicts be­tween tran­sit ve­hi­cles and other ve­hi­cles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer Points. Provide safe and con­ve­nient trans­fer points with cov­ered wait­ing ar­eas, tran­sit route in­for­ma­tion, benches, trash re­cep­ta­cles, en­hanced sign­ing, light­ing, and tele­phones. Limited tran­sit ser­vice should stop at trans­fer points and ac­tiv­ity cen­ters along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Classiﬁcation. Streets with dual Regional Transitway and Major Transit Priority Street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions should re­tain the op­er­a­tional char­ac­ter­is­tics of Major Transit Priority Streets, and de­vel­op­ment should ori­ent to the street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus Stops. Locate bus stops to pro­vide con­ve­nient ac­cess to neigh­bor­hoods and com­mer­cial cen­ters. Stops should be lo­cated rel­a­tively close to­gether in high-den­sity and medium-den­sity ar­eas, in­clud­ing re­gional and town cen­ters and along most main streets, and rel­a­tively far­ther apart in lower-den­sity ar­eas. Passenger ameni­ties should in­clude shel­ters and route in­for­ma­tion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.c. Transit Access Streets</strong> are in­tended for dis­trict-ori­ented tran­sit ser­vice serv­ing main streets, neigh­bor­hoods, and com­mer­cial, in­dus­trial, and em­ploy­ment ar­eas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Encourage pedes­trian- and tran­sit-ori­ented de­vel­op­ment in com­mer­cial, in­sti­tu­tional, and mixed-use ar­eas along Transit Access Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Transit. Provide safe and con­ve­nient pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle ac­cess to trans­fer points and stops and along Transit Access Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer Points. Provide bus shel­ters, safe and con­ve­nient pedes­trian cross­ings, and tran­sit in­for­ma­tion at trans­fer points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Employ tran­sit-pref­er­en­tial mea­sures at spe­ciﬁc in­ter­sec­tions to fa­cil­i­tate bus op­er­a­tions where there are sig­nif­i­cant bus de­lays. Applicable pref­er­en­tial treat­ments in­clude sig­nal pri­or­ity, queue jump lanes, and curb ex­ten­sions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus Stops. Locate stops closer to­gether in neigh­bor­hood com­mer­cial ar­eas and some­what far­ther apart in other ar­eas along Transit Access Streets. Passenger ameni­ties, in­clud­ing cov­ered wait­ing ar­eas, are ap­pro­pri­ate along Transit Access Streets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.d. Community Transit Streets</strong> serve neigh­bor­hoods and in­dus­trial ar­eas and con­nect to city­wide tran­sit ser­vice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Encourage pedes­trian- and tran­sit-ori­ented de­vel­op­ment in com­mer­cial, in­sti­tu­tional, and mixed-use ar­eas along Community Transit Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transit Service. Community Transit Streets typ­i­cally carry feeder bus ser­vice, mini-bus, or de­mand-re­spon­sive ser­vices. Demand-responsive ser­vice may in­clude ser­vice that is tai­lored to ar­eas (e.g., in­dus­trial ar­eas) that have un­usual tran­sit ser­vice needs. The size and type of tran­sit ve­hi­cle should be ap­pro­pri­ate to the needs of the land uses served.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pedestrian and Bicycle Access. Provide safe and con­ve­nient pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle ac­cess along Community Transit Streets and to trans­fer points and stops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Community Transit Streets are typ­i­cally used for ac­cess by bi­cy­clists, pedes­tri­ans, and dri­vers to reach neigh­bor­hood des­ti­na­tions. Parking re­moval or the ac­qui­si­tion of ad­di­tional right-of-way should not be un­der­taken to en­hance tran­sit ser­vice on Community Transit Streets, ex­cept at spe­ciﬁc lo­ca­tions to cor­rect un­safe tran­sit op­er­a­tions or ac­com­mo­date ac­cess to tran­sit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer Points. Provide cov­ered wait­ing ar­eas and tran­sit in­for­ma­tion at trans­fer points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus Stops. Locate stops closer to­gether in neigh­bor­hood com­mer­cial ar­eas and far­ther apart in other ar­eas along Community Transit Streets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.e. Local Service Transit Streets</strong> pro­vide tran­sit ser­vice to nearby res­i­dents and ad­ja­cent com­mer­cial ar­eas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Transit op­er­a­tions on Local Service Transit Streets should give pref­er­ence to ac­cess for in­di­vid­ual prop­er­ties and to the spe­ciﬁc needs of prop­erty own­ers and res­i­dents along the street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classiﬁcation. Streets not clas­si­ﬁed as Regional Transitways, Major Transit Priority Streets, Transit Access Streets, or Community Transit Streets are clas­si­ﬁed as Local Service Transit Streets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Local Service Transit Streets may be used for para­tran­sit ser­vice, end loops for reg­u­larly sched­uled routes, and may carry school buses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bus Stops. Locate stops along Local Service Transit Streets based on Tri-Met ser­vice stan­dards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.f. Transit Stations</strong> are lo­ca­tions where light rail ve­hi­cles or other high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit ve­hi­cles stop to board and un­load pas­sen­gers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Locations. Locate Transit Stations on Regional Transitways to pro­vide di­rect and con­ve­nient ser­vice to re­gional and town cen­ters and ma­jor trip gen­er­a­tors along the tran­sit­way. Station lo­ca­tions are con­cep­tual. Actual lo­ca­tions should be used for reg­u­la­tory pur­poses such as mea­sur­ing dis­tances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passenger Facilities. Provide safe and con­ve­nient cov­ered wait­ing ar­eas and easy trans­fer to other tran­sit ser­vices. Provide tran­sit in­for­ma­tion and ac­cess for pedes­tri­ans and bi­cy­clists. Transit Stations should have a full range of pas­sen­ger ser­vices, in­clud­ing route in­for­ma­tion, benches, se­cure bi­cy­cle park­ing, trash re­cep­ta­cles, en­hanced sign­ing, light­ing, and tele­phones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transit Station Spacing. Place Transit Stations along Regional Transitways with light rail ser­vice or other high-ca­pac­ity tran­sit ser­vice at in­ter­vals of ap­prox­i­mately one-half mile. In high-den­sity ar­eas in the Central City, con­sider closer sta­tion spac­ing of three to four blocks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.g. Intercity Passenger Rail</strong> pro­vides com­muter and other rail pas­sen­ger ser­vice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Station Spacing. Stations are typ­i­cally lo­cated one or more miles apart, de­pend­ing on over­all route length.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.4.h. Passenger Intermodal Facilities</strong> serve as the hub for var­i­ous pas­sen­ger modes and the trans­fer point be­tween modes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connections. Passenger Intermodal Facilities con­nect in­ter-ur­ban pas­sen­ger ser­vice with ur­ban pub­lic trans­porta­tion ser­vice and are highly ac­ces­si­ble by all modes.</li>
</ul>
<p>**Objective 9.5 Bicycle Classiﬁcation Descriptions (formerly Objective 6.7)
**</p>
<p><strong>9.5.a. Major City Bikeways</strong> form the back­bone of the city’s bike­way net­work and are in­tended to serve high vol­umes of bi­cy­cle traf­ﬁc and pro­vide di­rect, seam­less, ef­ﬁ­cient travel across and be­tween trans­porta­tion dis­tricts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Major City Bikeways should sup­port 2040 land use types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Major City Bikeways should be de­signed to ac­com­mo­date large vol­umes of bi­cy­clists, to max­i­mize their com­fort and to min­i­mize de­lays by em­pha­siz­ing the move­ment of bi­cy­cles. Build the high­est qual­ity bike­way fa­cil­i­ties. Motor ve­hi­cle lanes and on-street park­ing may be re­moved on Major City Bikeways to pro­vide needed width for sep­a­rated-in-road­way fa­cil­i­ties where com­pat­i­ble with ad­ja­cent land uses and only af­ter per­form­ing care­ful analy­sis to de­ter­mine po­ten­tial im­pacts to the es­sen­tial move­ment of all modes. Where im­prove­ments to the bi­cy­cling en­vi­ron­ment are needed but the abil­ity to re­al­lo­cate road space is lim­ited, con­sider al­ter­na­tive ap­proaches that in­clude prop­erty ac­qui­si­tion, or ded­i­ca­tion, par­al­lel routes and/​or less de­sir­able fa­cil­i­ties. On Major City Bikeways de­vel­oped as shared road­ways, use all ap­pro­pri­ate tools to achieve rec­om­mended per­for­mance guide­lines. Where con­di­tions war­rant and where prac­ti­cal, Major City Bikeways should have sep­a­rated fa­cil­i­ties for bi­cy­cles and pedes­tri­ans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.5.b. City Bikeways</strong> es­tab­lish di­rect and con­ve­nient bi­cy­cle ac­cess to sig­nif­i­cant des­ti­na­tions, to pro­vide con­ve­nient ac­cess to Major City Bikeways and to pro­vide cov­er­age within three city blocks of any given point.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. City Bikeways should sup­port 2040 land use types and res­i­den­tial neigh­bor­hoods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. City Bikeways em­pha­size the move­ment of bi­cy­cles. Build the high­est qual­ity
bike­way fa­cil­i­ties. Motor ve­hi­cle lanes and on-street park­ing may be re­moved on City Bikeways to pro­vide needed width for sep­a­rated-in-road­way fa­cil­i­ties where com­pat­i­ble with ad­ja­cent land uses and only af­ter tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion the es­sen­tial move­ment of all modes. Where im­prove­ments to the bi­cy­cling en­vi­ron­ment are needed but the abil­ity to re­al­lo­cate road space is lim­ited, con­sider al­ter­na­tive ap­proaches that in­clude prop­erty ac­qui­si­tion, or ded­i­ca­tion, par­al­lel routes and/​or less de­sir­able fa­cil­i­ties. On City Bikeways de­vel­oped as shared road­ways, use all ap­pro­pri­ate tools to achieve rec­om­mended per­for­mance guide­lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.5.c. Local Service Bikeways</strong> serve lo­cal cir­cu­la­tion needs for bi­cy­clists and pro­vide ac­cess to ad­ja­cent prop­er­ties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classiﬁcation. All streets not clas­si­ﬁed as City Bikeways or Major City Bikeways with the ex­cep­tion of Regional Trafﬁcways not also clas­si­ﬁed as Major City Trafﬁc Streets, are clas­si­ﬁed as Local Service Bikeways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Consider the fol­low­ing de­sign treat­ments for Local Service Bikeways: shared road­ways, traf­ﬁc calm­ing, bi­cy­cle lanes, and ex­tra-wide curb lanes. Crossings of Local Service Bikeways with other rights-of-way should min­i­mize con­ﬂicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-Street Parking. On-street park­ing on Local Service Bikeways should not be re­moved to pro­vide bi­cy­cle lanes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operation. Treatment of Local Service Bikeways should not have a side ef­fect of cre­at­ing, ac­com­mo­dat­ing, or en­cour­ag­ing au­to­mo­bile through-traf­ﬁc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.5.d. Bicycle Districts</strong> are ar­eas with a dense con­cen­tra­tion of com­mer­cial, cul­tural, in­sti­tu­tional and/​or recre­ational des­ti­na­tions where the City in­tends to make bi­cy­cle travel more at­trac­tive than dri­ving.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. High den­sity and mixed-use neigh­bor­hoods should be tar­geted as bi­cy­cle dis­tricts. Auto-oriented de­vel­op­ment should be dis­cour­aged in Bicycle Districts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characteristics. The size and con­ﬁg­u­ra­tion of a Bicycle District should be con­sis­tent with the scale of bi­cy­cling trips. A Bicycle District in­cludes the streets along its bound­aries, ex­cept where the abut­ting street is clas­si­ﬁed as a Regional Trafﬁcway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. All streets within a Bicycle District are im­por­tant in serv­ing bi­cy­cle trips. Appropriate bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties should be de­ter­mined for each street based on the de­sired bi­cy­cling con­di­tions and op­er­a­tions. Use the bike­way de­sign and en­gi­neer­ing guide­lines to de­sign streets within Bicycle Districts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective 9.6 Pedestrian Classiﬁcation Descriptions (formerly Objective 6.8)</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.6.a. Pedestrian Districts</strong> give pri­or­ity to pedes­trian ac­cess in ar­eas where high lev­els of pedes­trian ac­tiv­ity ex­ist or are planned, in­clud­ing the Central City, Gateway re­gional cen­ter, town cen­ters, and sta­tion com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Zoning should al­low a tran­sit-sup­port­ive den­sity of res­i­den­tial and com­mer­cial uses that sup­port lively and in­ten­sive pedes­trian ac­tiv­ity. Auto-oriented de­vel­op­ment should be dis­cour­aged in Pedestrian Districts. Institutional cam­puses that gen­er­ate high lev­els of pedes­trian ac­tiv­ity may be in­cluded in Pedestrian Districts. Exceptions to the den­sity and zon­ing cri­te­ria may be ap­pro­pri­ate in some des­ig­nated his­toric dis­tricts with a strong pedes­trian ori­en­ta­tion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streets within a District. Make walk­ing the mode of choice for all trips within a Pedestrian District. All streets within a Pedestrian District are equal in im­por­tance in serv­ing pedes­trian trips and should have side­walks on both sides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characteristics. The size and con­ﬁg­u­ra­tion of a Pedestrian District should be con­sis­tent with the scale of walk­ing trips. A Pedestrian District in­cludes both sides of the streets along its bound­aries, ex­cept where the abut­ting street is clas­si­ﬁed as a Regional Trafﬁcway. In these in­stances, the land up to the Regional Trafﬁcway is con­sid­ered part of the Pedestrian District, but the Regional Trafﬁcway it­self is not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to Transit. A Pedestrian District should have, or be planned to have, fre­quent tran­sit ser­vice and con­ve­nient ac­cess to tran­sit stops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to de­sign streets within Pedestrian Districts. Improvements may in­clude widened side­walks, curb ex­ten­sions, street light­ing, street trees, and sign­ing. Where two ar­te­ri­als cross, de­sign treat­ments such as curb ex­ten­sions, me­dian pedes­trian refuges, marked cross­walks, and traf­ﬁc sig­nals should be con­sid­ered to min­i­mize the cross­ing dis­tance, di­rect pedes­tri­ans across the safest route, and pro­vide safe gaps in the traf­ﬁc stream.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.6.b. Pedestrian-Transit Streets</strong> cre­ate a strong and vis­i­ble re­la­tion­ship be­tween pedes­tri­ans and tran­sit within the Central City.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Pedestrian-Transit Streets re­spond to sig­nif­i­cant pub­lic in­vest­ments in pub­lic trans­porta­tion, in­clud­ing light rail, the tran­sit mall, and street­car, and en­hance the pedes­trian en­vi­ron­ment ad­ja­cent to high-den­sity land uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Improvements should in­clude wide side­walks to ac­com­mo­date high lev­els of pedes­trian traf­ﬁc, ur­ban de­sign fea­tures that pro­mote pedes­trian ac­tiv­ity, and vi­sual sig­nals to mo­tor ve­hi­cles to rec­og­nize the pri­or­ity of pedes­trian and tran­sit ve­hi­cles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.6.c. City Walkways</strong> pro­vide safe, con­ve­nient, and at­trac­tive pedes­trian ac­cess to ac­tiv­i­ties along ma­jor streets and to recre­ation and in­sti­tu­tions; pro­vide con­nec­tions be­tween neigh­bor­hoods; and pro­vide ac­cess to tran­sit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. City Walkways should serve ar­eas with dense zon­ing, com­mer­cial ar­eas, and ma­jor des­ti­na­tions. Where auto-ori­ented land uses are al­lowed on City Walkways, site de­vel­op­ment stan­dards should ad­dress the needs of pedes­tri­ans for ac­cess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to de­sign City Walkways. Consider spe­cial de­sign treat­ment for City Walkways that are also des­ig­nated as Regional or Community Main Streets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.6.d. Off-Street Paths</strong> serve recre­ational and other walk­ing trips.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Function. Use Off-Street Paths as short cuts to link ur­ban des­ti­na­tions and ori­gins along con­tin­u­ous green­belts such as rivers, park and for­est ar­eas, and other scenic cor­ri­dors, and used as el­e­ments of a re­gional, city­wide, or com­mu­nity recre­ational trail plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Location. Establish Off-Street Paths in cor­ri­dors not well served by the street sys­tem. On ex­ist­ing rights-of-way that are not de­vel­oped or likely to be de­vel­oped in the near fu­ture, Off-Street Paths may be des­ig­nated where needed to com­plete the pedes­trian sys­tem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvements. Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to de­sign Off-Street Paths. Design Off-Street Paths as sep­a­rated fa­cil­i­ties that ac­com­mo­date pedes­tri­ans and may ac­com­mo­date other non-mo­tor­ized ve­hi­cles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.6.e Local Service Walkways</strong> serve lo­cal cir­cu­la­tion needs for pedes­tri­ans and pro­vide safe and con­ve­nient ac­cess to lo­cal des­ti­na­tions, in­clud­ing safe routes to schools.</p>

<p><strong>Objective 9.9 Street Design Classiﬁcation Descriptions (formerly Objective 6.11)</strong></p>
<p>Street Design Classiﬁcation Descriptions pro­vide gen­eral de­sign guid­ance based on the cur­rent and planned land use con­text around the street. Whenever pos­si­ble, a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>complete streets” ap­proach should be taken dur­ing street de­sign to ac­com­mo­date all nec­es­sary modes and func­tions, tak­ing into ac­count the modal clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions. Where right-of-way is lim­ited and trade­offs must be made, re­fer to the modal street clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tions as well as Policy 9.6 (Transportation strat­egy for peo­ple move­ment) to help guide de­ci­sion-mak­ing re­gard­ing al­lo­ca­tion of right-of-way. If one or more modes are still un­able to be ac­com­mo­dated in the avail­able right-of-way, a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>complete net­works” ap­proach should be used to en­sure that those modes are still ac­com­mo­dated on par­al­lel routes as a part of pro­ject de­sign.</p>

<p><strong>9.9.g. Urban Throughways</strong> are de­signed to em­pha­size long-dis­tance mo­bil­ity for mo­tor ve­hi­cle, freight, and tran­sit trips through­out the re­gion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Urban Throughways con­nect ma­jor ac­tiv­ity cen­ters, in­dus­trial ar­eas, and in­ter­modal fa­cil­i­ties. Adjacent land uses some­times ori­ent di­rectly to Urban Throughways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of Lanes. Urban Throughways usu­ally have four to six ve­hi­cle lanes, with ad­di­tional lanes in some sit­u­a­tions. Dedicated high-oc­cu­pancy-ve­hi­cle, freight-only, or tran­sit-only lanes may be pro­vided to sup­port more ef­ﬁ­cient use of Urban Throughways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Urban Throughways pri­mar­ily serve a mo­bil­ity func­tion, with lit­tle or no lo­cal ac­cess pro­vided along the street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separation. Urban Throughways may be com­pletely di­vided, with no left turns, or they may be mostly di­vided, with lim­ited op­por­tu­ni­ties for left turns. Street con­nec­tions may oc­cur at sep­a­rated grades, with ac­cess con­trolled by ramps, or there may be lim­ited street con­nec­tions at grade. If de­signed as a grade-sep­a­rated free­way, pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle cross­ings should be pro­vided on over­passes or un­der­passes, and pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties along the cor­ri­dor should be pro­vided on par­al­lel path­ways. If de­signed as a lim­ited-ac­cess high­way or ex­press­way, pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle cross­ings should be ei­ther grade-sep­a­rated or sig­nal­ized, and pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties should be sep­a­rated from mo­tor ve­hi­cle traf­ﬁc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Elements. Urban Throughway de­sign typ­i­cally in­cludes ve­hi­cle lanes, grade-sep­a­rated or sig­nal­ized pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle, par­al­lel path­ways or sep­a­rated fa­cil­i­ties for pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle travel, clear sight­lines, me­dian bar­ri­ers, shoul­ders, and mo­tor ve­hi­cle lane widths that ac­com­mo­date freight move­ment. Where ap­pro­pri­ate, tran­sit pri­or­ity treat­ments should be used to en­hance tran­sit speed and re­li­a­bil­ity. Encourage the Oregon Department of Transportation to main­tain a con­tin­u­ous land­scape along Urban Throughways that re­duces the vi­sual im­pacts of the through­way on mo­torists and ad­ja­cent land uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connections. A ramp that con­nects to an Urban Throughway is clas­si­ﬁed as an Urban Throughway up to its in­ter­sec­tion with a dif­fer­ently-clas­si­ﬁed street. An in­ter­change be­tween an Urban Throughway and a dif­fer­ently-clas­si­ﬁed street should be de­signed to safely ac­com­mo­date all modes and pro­vide the least pos­si­ble dis­rup­tion to the sur­round­ing modal net­works. Connections should be pro­vided across Urban Throughways at closely-spaced in­ter­vals to pro­vide greater street con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>

<p><strong>9.9.h. Industrial Roads</strong> are de­signed to em­pha­size freight mo­bil­ity while also ac­com­mo­dat­ing other modes and pro­vid­ing lo­cal ac­cess.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Industrial Roads typ­i­cally serve in­dus­trial ar­eas and freight in­ter­modal sites, with a sig­nif­i­cant per­cent­age of trips be­ing made by trucks. Adjacent land uses some­times ori­ent to the Industrial Road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of Lanes. Industrial Road de­sign typ­i­cally in­cludes two to four ve­hi­cle lanes, with ad­di­tional turn­ing lanes as needed. Dedicated freight-only lanes or turn pock­ets may be pro­vided as needed to sup­port road­way ef­ﬁ­ciency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function. Industrial Roads em­pha­size freight mo­bil­ity while ac­com­mo­dat­ing other modes and pro­vid­ing ac­cess to in­dus­trial sites and freight dis­tricts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curb zone. The curb zone along Industrial Roads pri­mar­ily serves mo­bil­ity func­tions such as ve­hi­cle lanes or bike lanes. The curb zone may be used for ac­cess func­tions such as park­ing and load­ing at lim­ited lo­ca­tions if needed to sup­port ad­ja­cent land use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separation. Industrial Roads have lim­ited street con­nec­tions that may oc­cur at the same grade or sep­a­rate grades. Pedestrian and bi­cy­cle cross­ings should be grade-sep­a­rated or sig­nal­ized, and pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties should be sep­a­rated from mo­tor ve­hi­cle traf­ﬁc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Elements. Industrial Road de­sign typ­i­cally in­cludes ve­hi­cle lanes, me­di­ans or cen­ter turn lanes where needed, lim­ited dri­ve­way ac­cess, pull­outs for bus stops, tran­sit pri­or­ity treat­ments, sep­a­rated pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties, and im­proved pedes­trian cross­ings lo­cated on over­passes, un­der­passes, or sig­nal­ized at-grade in­ter­sec­tions. Industrial Roads may also in­clude de­sign treat­ments that im­prove freight mo­bil­ity, such as freight-only lanes, freight sig­nal pri­or­ity, and a wider turn­ing ra­dius at in­ter­sec­tions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.i. Enhanced Greenway Corridors</strong> are de­signed to pro­vide a net­work of scenic low-stress con­nec­tions that pri­or­i­tize walk­ing and/​or bi­cy­cling and of­ten in­clude nat­ural fea­tures as well as in­no­v­a­tive ur­ban de­sign and place-mak­ing el­e­ments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dual Classiﬁcation. Streets may have an Enhanced Greenway Corridor clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion in ad­di­tion to an­other street de­sign clas­si­ﬁ­ca­tion. When de­vel­op­ing or retro­ﬁtting these streets, in­cor­po­rate Enhanced Greenway Corridor de­sign el­e­ments within the cor­ri­dor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Enhanced Greenway Corridors con­nect parks, open spaces, and sin­gu­lar at­trac­tions through­out the City to each other and to sur­round­ing neigh­bor­hoods via a net­work of scenic and low-stress walk­ing and/​or bi­cy­cling routes. They can run through a va­ri­ety of dif­fer­ent land use con­texts, in­clud­ing res­i­den­tial neigh­bor­hoods, nat­ural ar­eas, in­dus­trial ar­eas, and em­ploy­ment cen­ters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Elements. Enhanced Greenway Corridor de­sign can take many forms, and should use ﬂex­i­ble de­sign treat­ments ap­pro­pri­ate to ad­ja­cent land use con­text. Design el­e­ments may in­clude: neigh­bor­hood green­ways; traf­ﬁc calm­ing; mo­tor ve­hi­cle di­ver­sion; multi-use paths; wide side­walks; board­walks; trails; sep­a­rated bike­ways; broad-canopy trees and land­scap­ing; scenic views; stormwa­ter man­age­ment; un­der­ground util­i­ties; spe­cial light­ing; and way-ﬁnd­ing. Where ap­pro­pri­ate, pedes­trian and bi­cy­cle routes may use sep­a­rate par­al­lel routes or streets along a cor­ri­dor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.j. Greenscape Streets</strong></p>
<p>Greenscape Street de­signs are ap­plied to ar­te­ri­als where nat­ural or in­for­mal land­scapes dom­i­nate the ad­ja­cent ar­eas and the right-of-way, such as lower-den­sity res­i­den­tial ar­eas in wooded set­tings.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dual Classiﬁcations. Where streets have a Greenscape Street de­sign des­ig­na­tion and an­other street de­sign des­ig­na­tion, con­sider the nat­ural char­ac­ter­is­tics of the street dur­ing the de­sign and im­ple­men­ta­tion of street im­prove­ments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design Treatment. During im­prove­ment pro­jects, con­sider the use of veg­e­tated stormwa­ter treat­ment tech­niques; min­i­miz­ing im­per­vi­ous sur­faces; preser­va­tion of ex­ist­ing veg­e­ta­tion, topog­ra­phy, vis­tas and view­points, dri­ver per­cep­tion, street light­ing, and sight dis­tance re­quire­ments. Vegetation may be land­scaped or na­tive, de­pend­ing on the ex­ist­ing and de­sired char­ac­ter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9.9.k. Local Streets</strong> are de­signed to com­ple­ment planned land uses and re­duce de­pen­dence on ar­te­ri­als for lo­cal cir­cu­la­tion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Land Use. Local Streets are mul­ti­modal, but are not in­tended for trucks (other than lo­cal de­liv­er­ies) in res­i­den­tial ar­eas. Local Streets are im­por­tant for lo­cal cir­cu­la­tion of trucks in com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial ar­eas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design. Local Street de­sign typ­i­cally in­cludes fre­quent street con­nec­tions, side­walks, on-street park­ing, stormwa­ter fa­cil­i­ties, and plant­ing of street trees and ground cov­ers (where plant­ing strips are in­cluded). A shared street de­sign with­out side­walks may be ap­pro­pri­ate where traf­ﬁc vol­umes are suf­ﬁ­ciently low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classiﬁcation. All streets not clas­si­ﬁed as Urban Throughways, Urban Highways, Industrial Roads, Civic Main Streets, Neighborhood Main Streets, Civic Corridors, Neighborhood Corridors, Regional Corridors, or Community Corridors are clas­si­ﬁed as Local Streets for street de­sign.</p>

<p><strong>8.1.i.</strong> Construct lo­cal res­i­den­tial streets to min­i­mize pave­ment width and to­tal right-of-way width, con­sis­tent with the op­er­a­tional needs of the fa­cil­ity and tak­ing into ac­count the needs of both pedes­tri­ans and ve­hi­cles.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.j.</strong> Ensure that trans­porta­tion fa­cil­i­ties are ac­ces­si­ble to all peo­ple and that all im­prove­ments to the trans­porta­tion sys­tem (trafﬁc, tran­sit, bi­cy­cle, and pedes­trian) in the pub­lic right-of-way com­ply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.k.</strong> Encourage the beau­ti­ﬁ­ca­tion of the City by in­cor­po­rat­ing ap­pro­pri­ate streetscape el­e­ments along re­gion­ally des­ig­nated streets and along other City-designated ar­te­ri­als, in con­junc­tion with the Urban Forestry Program.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.l.</strong> Encourage the for­ma­tion of lo­cal im­prove­ment dis­tricts (LIDs) for the con­struc­tion of trans­porta­tion in­fra­struc­ture, which may in­clude streets, curbs, or other struc­tures; pedes­trian or bi­cy­cle fa­cil­i­ties; drainage; and street trees.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.m.</strong> Continue to ex­plore cost-ef­fec­tive meth­ods to ﬁ­nance lo­cal street im­prove­ments, in­clud­ing green streets pro­jects.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.n.</strong> Consider and min­i­mize im­pacts on the nat­ural en­vi­ron­ment and wa­ter­shed health, con­sis­tent with the City and re­gional re­sponse to the Endangered Species Act, the City’s Green Streets Policy and stream cross­ing de­sign guide­lines in the Green Streets hand­book, in the plan­ning, de­sign, and de­vel­op­ment of trans­porta­tion pro­jects.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.o.</strong> Consider the de­sired char­ac­ter of the area, in­clud­ing neigh­bor­hood liv­abil­ity, in the de­sign and de­vel­op­ment of trans­porta­tion pro­jects.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.p.</strong> Develop stan­dards and in­cen­tives to en­cour­age Green Streets pro­jects in pri­vate de­vel­op­ment, re­de­vel­op­ment and en­hance­ment pro­jects wher­ever tech­ni­cally and eco­nom­i­cally fea­si­ble.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.q.</strong> Require ad­e­quate right-of-way or ease­ments where ad­e­quate space for planned bike­way and pedes­trian fa­cil­i­ties is not avail­able.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.r.</strong> Continue to test, eval­u­ate, and im­ple­ment ap­pro­pri­ate in­no­v­a­tive de­sign treat­ments that im­prove op­er­at­ing con­di­tions and safety for cy­clists.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.s.</strong> Utilize in­terim bi­cy­cle fa­cil­ity im­prove­ments where the pre­ferred de­sign treat­ment is not cur­rently fea­si­ble.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 8.2 Environmental Sustainability (formerly Objective 11.8)</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.2.a.</strong> Integrate best man­age­ment prac­tices into all as­pects of the Portland Bureau of Transportation ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>8.2.b.</strong> Continue to reuse and re­cy­cle of­ﬁce and con­struc­tion ma­te­ri­als and equip­ment, com­post leaves, and sep­a­rate street de­bris.</p>
<p><strong>8.2.c.</strong> Maintain equip­ment and fa­cil­i­ties to min­i­mize air, wa­ter, and noise pol­lu­tion.</p>
<p><strong>8.2.d.</strong> Use en­vi­ron­men­tally safe prod­ucts.</p>
<p><strong>8.2.e.</strong> Minimize runoff and ero­sion in all ground-dis­turb­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing con­struc­tion, ex­ca­va­tion, land­scap­ing, and trench work.</p>
<p><strong>8.2.f.</strong> Use al­ter­na­tive en­ergy sources to power equip­ment when­ever fea­si­ble.</p>
<p><strong>8.2.g.</strong> Incorporate sus­tain­able and Green Street de­sign so­lu­tions for streets and other trans­porta­tion pro­jects.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 8.3 Maintenance (formerly Objective 11.12)</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.3.a.</strong> Consider the po­ten­tial im­pacts of main­te­nance oblig­a­tions and life-cy­cle costs in the de­vel­op­ment of trans­porta­tion pro­jects and pro­grams.</p>
<p><strong>8.3.b.</strong> Incorporate retro­ﬁtting or re­mov­ing im­per­vi­ous sur­faces and cul­verts iden­ti­ﬁed in the re­gion’s ﬁsh pas­sage and wa­ter­shed man­age­ment pro­grams into main­te­nance ac­tiv­i­ties for the trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</p>
<p><strong>8.3.c.</strong> Use best man­age­ment prac­tices to ad­dress en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pacts of main­te­nance ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
<p><strong>8.3.d.</strong> Pursue strate­gies for new sources of rev­enues for main­te­nance of the trans­porta­tion sys­tem.</p>
