<p>Portland is projected to add 140,000 new jobs and 260,000 new residents over the next 20 years. As Portland and the region grow, however, there is a continuing challenge to maintain the natural environment, economic prosperity, and overall quality of life. If in 2035 the percentage of people who drive alone to work remains the same as it is now (nearly 60 percent), traffic, carbon emissions, and household spending on vehicles and fuel will all worsen significantly. In order to accommodate this growth, our transportation system must provide Portlanders safer and more convenient ways to walk, bike, and take transit for more trips. The 2035 Transportation System Plan guides investments to maintain and improve the livability of Portland by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>supporting the City’s commitment to Vision Zero by saving lives and reducing injuries to all people using our transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>limiting traffic congestion so transit and freight vehicles can move more reliably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reducing, carbon emissions and promoting healthy lifestyles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keeping more money in the local economy, as we spend less on vehicles and fuel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creating great places</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Transportation System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide transportation policies and investments in Portland. The TSP meets state and regional planning requirements and addresses local transportation needs. Transportation planning that promotes active transportation modes is essential to preserving the City’s livability and for the protection of the natural environment Constructing significant amounts of new automobile capacity to accommodate growth is not a viable option because of the enormous costs and impacts. Adding more streets and parking lots divides neighborhoods, uses valuable land, encourages urban sprawl, and has negative environmental impacts. Alternative approaches, supporting a safer, more affordable and more complete multimodal transportation network must be used to ensure integrated, comprehensive solutions. The first TSP was adopted by Council in 2002 (Ordinance 177028).</p>
<p>The Transportation System Plan helps implement the City’s 2035 Comprehensive Plan in addition to the region’s 2040 Growth Concept by supporting a transportation system that makes it more convenient for people to walk, bicycle, use transit, and drive less to meet their daily needs. The TSP also recognizes that the transportation system must help grow and sustain the City’s economic health by accommodating the needs of businesses and supporting Portland’s role in the international economy.</p>
<p><strong>The 2035 TSP includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Goals and policies that guide the maintenance, development and implementation of Portland’s transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objectives that further the implementation of the goals and policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of projects and City wide programs along with a financial plan that would accommodate 20 years of population and employment growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master street plans and modal plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategies and regulations for implementation, including street classifications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="elements-of-the-tsp">Elements of the TSP</h1>
<p>The goals and policies, street classification descriptions and maps, the financial plan and the master street plan maps in the TSP were adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan by City Council in 2016. The TSP was adopted concurrently with the Comprehensive Plan, but published under a separate cover. Stage 3 Update will be adopted separately from the Comp Plan and Stages 1 and 2, then incorporated into one TSP document.</p>
<p>The TSP is both an implementation tool and a supporting document to the Comprehensive Plan. It contains the transportation element of the City’s Public Facilities Plan, and the List of Significant Projects and Citywide Programs. The TSP also provides more detail than the Comprehensive Plan by including additional supporting information about transportation system conditions.</p>
<p><img src="/img/media/image2.png" alt="Relation to Other Plans_updated 10_03_14.png"></p>
<h1 id="transportation-system-plan-updates">Transportation System Plan Updates</h1>
<p>In order to keep the TSP current and up-to-date with recent transportation planning and development activities, it is updated at regular intervals. The first two updates in the mid-2000s were not intended to include new policy initiatives. They were primarily technical in nature and included corrections, updates to project descriptions, updates on studies, and inclusion of new master street plans adopted as a part of planning efforts.</p>
<p>The first update was completed and adopted by City Council on October 13, 2004 (effective date, November 12, 2004; Ordinance Nos. 178815 and 178826).</p>
<p>The second update was completed and adopted by City Council on April 5, 2007 (effective date, May 5, 2007; Ordinance No 180871). While primarily technical in nature, this update also included new policy language to implement the City’s Green Street Policy.</p>
<p>Stage 1 TSP Update was a part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan update process and a component of the state’s Periodic Work Plan Task 4. It included Goals, Policies, Projects and Programs and a Financial Plan. It was adopted by City Council in June 2016.</p>
<p>The Stage 2 TSP Update was a part of the City’s Comprehensive Plan update and changes were made to implement the Comp Plan, as well as reflect adopted plans and classification changes since the last update in 2007. Periodic Work Plan Task 5. It was adopted by City Council in December 2016.</p>
<p>TSP Stage 3 TSP Update is incorporating regional information, updating geographic policies and objectives, updating objectives, adding a few policies, changes to street classification for traffic, transit and emergency response, modal plans, and other changes as identified. There is also parallel staff process to reformat the document and create a new user friendly digital document.</p>
<h1 id="regulatory-framework">Regulatory Framework</h1>
<p>The TSP addresses and complies with a number of State and regional goals, policies, and regulations, as summarized below.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-oregon">State of Oregon</h2>
<p><em>Statewide Planning Goals</em></p>
<p>Oregon has 19 goals that provide a foundation for the State’s land use planning program. The TSP must comply with all applicable State goals. The two goals directly applicable to the TSP are Goal 11: Public Facilities Plan and Goal 12: Transportation.</p>
<p><em>Transportation Planning Rule</em></p>
<p>The Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) implements statewide planning Goal 12: Transportation. The TPR requires State, regional, and local jurisdictions to develop Transportation System Plans (TSPs) that comply with TPR provisions. These provisions include reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 10 percent over the next 20 years, reducing parking spaces per capita, and improving opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<p><em>Oregon Transportation Plan</em></p>
<p>The Oregon Transportation Plan (OTP) serves as the State’s TSP. Regional and local TSPs must be consistent with the OTP.</p>
<h2 id="regional-metro">Regional Metro</h2>
<p><em>Regional Transportation Plan</em></p>
<p>First adopted by Metro in 1983, with latest update in 2014, the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) serves as the regional TSP. As such, the RTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is consistent with the requirements of the State TPR and OTP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implements the 2040 Growth Concept and Regional Framework Plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focuses on the regional transportation system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes multimodal functional classifications and street design classifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes a list of major system improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes a funding plan</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of August 2017 Metro and regional partners are updating the RTP with a new RTP to be issued in 2018.</p>
<p><em>Region 2040 Growth Concept</em></p>
<p>Metro adopted the 2040 Growth Concept as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. The 2040 Growth Concept stated the preferred form of long-term regional growth and development, including the urban growth boundary (UGB), density, and open space protection. It also designates design types, such as central city, regional center, town center, and main street.</p>
<p><em>Regional Transportation Functional Plan</em></p>
<p>The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (first adopted in 2010, last updated in 2012; Ordinance No 10-1241B) implements the Goals and Objectives in section 2.3 of the RTP and the policies of the RTP, and replaces the regional parking policy of the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (See RTFP Title 4: Regional Parking Management.) It provides policy basis and direction for local TSPs. The RTFP codifies requirements that local plans must comply with to be consistent with the Regional Transportation Plan. Therefore, its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>
<p><em>Urban Growth Management Functional Plan</em></p>
<p>Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP) in 1996 and updated it 2014 to implement regional goals and objectives adopted by the Metro Council as the Regional Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGO), including the 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework Plan. The UGMFP addresses the accommodation of regional population and job growth. Its requirements are binding on cities and counties.</p>
<p><em>Regional Framework Plan</em></p>
<p>The Regional Framework Plan, adopted in 1997, identifies regional policies to implement the 2040 Growth Concept, preserving access to nature and building great communities for today and the future. The plan was amended in 2005 and 2010, and again in 2014 as part of the adoption of the Climate Smart Strategy.</p>

<h2 id="pedestrian-classification-descriptions-adopted-2002-currently-under-review-see-the-update-of-the-pedestrian-master-planunderline">Pedestrian Classification Descriptions <em>(adopted 2002, currently under review. See the update of the <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/document-library/citywide-plans/modal-plans/pedestrian-master-plan">[Pedestrian Master Plan]{.underline}</a>)</em></h2>
<p>Pedestrian Classification Descriptions maintain a system of pedestrianways to serve all types of pedestrian trips, particularly those with a transportation function.</p>
<h3 id="pedestrian-districts">Pedestrian Districts</h3>
<p>Pedestrian Districts are intended to give priority to pedestrian access in areas where high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned, including the Central City, Gateway regional center, town centers, and station communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Zoning should allow a transit-supportive density of residential and commercial uses that support lively and intensive pedestrian activity. Auto- oriented development should be discouraged in Pedestrian Districts. Institutional campuses that generate high levels of pedestrian activity may be included in Pedestrian Districts. Exceptions to the density and zoning criteria may be appropriate in some designated historic districts with a strong pedestrian orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Streets within a District:</strong> Make walking the mode of choice for all trips within a Pedestrian District. All streets within a Pedestrian District are equal in importance in serving pedestrian trips and should have sidewalks on both sides.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The size and configuration of a Pedestrian District should be consistent with the scale of walking trips. A Pedestrian District includes both sides of the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway. In these instances, the land up to the Regional Trafficway is considered part of the Pedestrian District, but the Regional Trafficway itself is not.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> A Pedestrian District should have, or be planned to have, frequent transit service and convenient access to transit stops.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design streets within Pedestrian Districts. Improvements may include widened sidewalks, curb extensions, street lighting, street trees, and signing. Where two arterials cross, design treatments such as curb extensions, median pedestrian refuges, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals should be considered to minimize the crossing distance, direct pedestrians across the safest route, and provide safe gaps in the traffic stream.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="pedestrian-transit-streets">Pedestrian-Transit Streets</h3>
<p>Pedestrian-Transit Streets are intended to create a strong and visible relationship between pedestrians and transit within the Central City.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Pedestrian-Transit Streets respond to significant public investments in public transportation, including light rail, the transit mall, and streetcar, and enhance the pedestrian environment adjacent to high-density land uses.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Improvements should include wide sidewalks to accommodate high levels of pedestrian traffic, urban design features that promote pedestrian activity, and visual signals to motor vehicles to recognize the priority of pedestrian and transit vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="city-walkways">City Walkways</h3>
<p>City Walkways are intended to provide safe, convenient, and attractive pedestrian access to activities along major streets and to recreation and institutions; provide connections between neighborhoods; and provide access to transit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> City Walkways should serve areas with dense zoning, commercial areas, and major destinations. Where auto-oriented land uses are allowed on City Walkways, site development standards should address the needs of pedestrians for access.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design City Walkways. Consider special design treatment for City Walkways that are also designated as Regional or Community Main Streets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="off-street-paths">Off-Street Paths</h3>
<p>Off-Street Paths are intended to serve recreational and other walking trips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Use Off-Street Paths as shortcuts to link urban destinations and origins along continuous greenbelts such as rivers, park and forest areas, and other scenic corridors, and used as elements of a regional, citywide, or community recreational trail plan.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Establish Off-Street Paths in corridors not well served by the street system. On existing rights-of-way that are not developed or likely to be developed in the near future, Off-Street Paths may be designated where needed to complete the pedestrian system.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Off-Street Paths. Design Off-Street Paths as separated facilities that accommodate pedestrians and may accommodate other non-motorized vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-walkways">Local Service Walkways</h3>
<p>Local Service Walkways are intended to serve local circulation needs for pedestrians and provide safe and convenient access to local destinations, including safe routes to schools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Local Service Walkways are usually located in residential, commercial, or industrial areas on Local Service Traffic Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as City Walkways or Off-Street Paths, with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Walkways.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Local Service Walkways.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="bicycle-classification-descriptions">Bicycle Classification Descriptions</h2>
<h3 id="major-city-bikeways">Major City Bikeways</h3>
<p>Major City Bikeways form the backbone of the city’s bikeway network and are intended to serve high volumes of bicycle traffic and provide direct, seamless, efficient travel across and between transportation districts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Major City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Major City Bikeways should be designed to accommodate large volumes of bicyclists, to maximize their comfort and to minimize delays by emphasizing the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on Major City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after performing careful analysis to determine potential impacts to the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On Major City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines. Where conditions warrant and where practical, Major City Bikeways should have separated facilities for bicycles and pedestrians.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=""></h3>
<h3 id="city-bikeways">City Bikeways</h3>
<p>City Bikeways are intended to establish direct and convenient bicycle access to significant destinations, to provide convenient access to Major City Bikeways and to provide coverage within three city blocks of any given point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types and residential neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> City Bikeways emphasize the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after taking into consideration the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-bikeways">Local Service Bikeways</h3>
<p>Local Service Bikeways are intended to serve local circulation needs for bicyclists and provide access to adjacent properties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as City Bikeways or Major City Bikeways with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Bikeways.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Consider the following design treatments for Local Service Bikeways: shared roadways, traffic calming, bicycle lanes, and extra-wide curb lanes. Crossings of Local Service Bikeways with other rights-of-way should minimize conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>On-Street Parking:</strong> On-street parking on Local Service Bikeways should not be removed to provide bicycle lanes.</p>
<p><strong>Operation:</strong> Treatment of Local Service Bikeways should not have a side effect of creating, accommodating, or encouraging automobile through-traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bicycle-districts">Bicycle Districts</h3>
<p>Bicycle Districts are areas with a dense concentration of commercial, cultural, institutional and/or recreational destinations where the City intends to make bicycle travel more attractive than driving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> High density and mixed-use neighborhoods should be targeted as bicycle districts. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged in Bicycle Districts.</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The size and configuration of a Bicycle District should be consistent with the scale of bicycling trips. A Bicycle District includes the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> All streets within a Bicycle District are important in serving bicycle trips. Appropriate bicycle facilities should be determined for each street based on the desired bicycling conditions and operations. Use the bikeway design and engineering guidelines to design streets within Bicycle Districts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="transit-classification-descriptions">Transit Classification Descriptions</h2>
<p>Maintain a system of transit streets that supports the movement of transit vehicles for regional, interdistrict, and local trips.</p>
<h3 id="regional-transitways">Regional Transitways</h3>
<p>Regional Transitways are intended to facilitate regional and interdistrict transit trips with fast and reliable service over long distances, operating in right-of-way exclusively reserved for transit use to the extent possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Development with a regional attraction (e.g., shopping centers, arenas) are encouraged to locate adjacent to Regional Transitway stations to reduce traffic impacts on adjoining areas and streets. Locate high-density development within a half-mile of transit stations on Regional Transitways, with the highest densities closest to the stations.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> Transit stations should be designed to accommodate a high level of safe multimodal access within a half-mile radius of the station. Provide convenient connection opportunities at Regional Transitway stations when feasible, including feeder bus service, bike-share stations, secure bicycle parking, pick-up and drop-off zones, and shuttle services. Use park-and-ride facilities to access Regional Transit stations only at ends of Regional Transitways or where adequate feeder bus service is not feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Use transit-preferential treatments to facilitate fast and reliable transit operations. Provide signal preemption or transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stations or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Provide exclusive or semi-exclusive transitways wherever possible, including treatments on freeways and expressways such as transit lanes, HOV lanes, HOT lanes, and “bus on shoulder” operations. Employ access management measures to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles. Right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures and improve access to transit. Carefully consider any street design changes to Regional Transitways that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.</p>
<p><strong>Transit Stations:</strong> Locate Regional Transitway stations at intervals of approximately one-half mile to two miles, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points, and people with disabilities. Express or limited service may have stations located further apart, as appropriate to serve origins and destinations. Transit stations should have a full range of passenger services, including accessible boarding platforms, covered waiting areas, route information, benches, secure bicycle parking, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.<br>
<br>
<strong>Bus stops:</strong> Buses providing local service along Regional Transitways should have more frequent stop spacing, similar to stop spacing along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> A street with a dual Regional Transitway and Major Transit Priority Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major Transit Priority Street and respond to adjacent land uses.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> A ramp that connects to a Regional Transitway is classified as a Regional Transitway up to its intersection with a lower-classified street.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="major-transit-priority-streets">Major Transit Priority Streets</h3>
<p>Major Transit Priority Streets facilitate the frequent and reliable movement of transit vehicles that connect Central City, regional centers, and town centers with each other and to other major destinations. Major Transit Priority Streets are provided frequent service, or are expected to receive that level of service in the future to support envisioned growth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Transit-oriented land uses should be encouraged to locate along Major Transit Priority Streets, especially in centers. Discourage auto-oriented develop­ment from locating on a Major Transit Priority Street, except where the street is outside the Central City, center, station community, or main street and is also classified as a Major City Traffic Street. Support land use densi­ties that vary directly with the existing and planned capacity of transit service.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> Provide safe and convenient access for pedestrians and bicyclists to, across, and along Major Transit Priority Streets. Provide safe and accessible pedestrian crossings at all transit stops along Major Transit Priority Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Provide transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stops or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Consider the use of exclusive or semi-exclusive transit lanes where needed to reduce congestion-related transit delay. Design intersections of Major Transit Priority Streets with other Major Transit Priority Streets or Transit Access Streets to allow turning movements of a standard transit vehicle. Where compatible with adjacent land use designations, right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures or improve access to transit. The use of access manage­ment should be considered where needed to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles.Carefully consider any street design changes to Major Transit Priority Streets that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Major Transit Priority Streets are not eligible for new traffic slowing devices such as speed bumps or speed cushions. Existing traffic slowing devices on Major Transit Priority Streets may remain and may be maintained and replaced as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer Points:</strong> Provide safe and convenient transfer points with accessible stops, covered waiting areas, transit route information, benches, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Stops:</strong> Locate bus stops to provide convenient access to neighborhoods and commercial centers. Stops should be located roughly every one-quarter to one-half mile, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points and people with disabilities. Stop spacing should also take into account existing sidewalk and street connectivity, with potentially closer stop spacing where sidewalk and street connectivity is more limited. On-street parking should be prohibited at bus stops in order to provide accessible waiting areas. Passenger amenities should include shelters and route information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="transit-access-streets">Transit Access Streets</h3>
<p>Transit Access Streets facilitate movement of transit vehicles connecting town centers, neighborhood centers, and industrial and employment areas with other destinations and other transit service. Transit Access Streets are provided fixed-route service that is commensurate with the level of demand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Encourage pedestrian- and transit-oriented development in commercial, institutional, and mixed-use areas along Transit Access Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Transit:</strong> Provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access to transfer points and stops and along Transit Access Streets. Provide safe and accessible pedestrian crossings at all transit stops along Transit Access Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer Points:</strong> Provide bus shelters, safe and convenient pedestrian crossings, and transit information at transfer points.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Provide transit signal priority as needed at major intersections and prioritize transit stops over on-street parking. Provide sufficient lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles where appropriate, taking into account other street classifications.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Transit Access Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for traffic slowing devices such as speed bumps or speed cushions. Traffic slowing devices should be designed in accordance with TriMet guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Stops:</strong> Stops should be located roughly every one-quarter mile, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, and transfer points. Stop spacing should also take into account existing sidewalk and street connectivity, with potentially closer stop spacing where sidewalk and street connectivity is more limited. On-street parking should be prohibited at bus stops in order to provide accessible waiting areas. Passenger amenities, including covered waiting areas, are appropriate along Transit Access Streets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-transit-streets">Local Service Transit Streets</h3>
<p>Local Service Transit Streets primarily facilitate movement of smaller transit vehicles, including paratransit and community/jobs connector shuttles. Local Service Transit Streets seldom have regular transit service except for short street segments and do not typically include transit-specific street design elements such as bus stops. Local Service Transit Streets may be used for bus movements to and from a layover facility or bus garage, for turning around at the end of a line, or for temporary reroutes of a fixed-route line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Transit operations on Local Service Transit Streets should give preference to access for individual properties and to the specific needs of property owners and residents along the street.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Streets not classified as Regional Transitways, Major Transit Priority Streets, or Transit Access Streets are classified as Local Service Transit Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Local Service Transit Streets may be used for paratransit service, community/jobs connector service, end loops for regularly scheduled routes, or temporary detours, and may carry school buses.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Stops:</strong> If needed, locate stops along Local Service Transit Streets based on adopted service standards.</p>

<h2 id="street-design-classification-descriptions">Street Design Classification Descriptions</h2>
<p>Street Design Classification Descriptions provide general design guidance based on the current and planned land use context around the street. Whenever possible, a “complete streets” approach should be taken during street design to accommodate all necessary modes and functions, taking into account the modal classifications. Where right-of-way is limited and tradeoffs must be made, refer to the modal street classifications as well as the Transportation Strategy for People Movement (Policy 9.6) to help guide decision-making regarding allocation of right-of-way. If one or more modes are still unable to be accommodated in the available right-of-way, a “complete networks” approach should be used to ensure that those modes are still accommodated on parallel routes as a part of project design.</p>
<h3 id="civic-main-streets">Civic Main Streets</h3>
<p>Civic Main Streets serve people throughout the City and are designed to emphasize multimodal access to major activity centers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Civic Main Streets are segments of Civic Corridors located within the Central City, Regional Centers, Town Centers, Neighborhood Centers, and other areas of intensive commercial activity. Development consists of a mix of uses that are oriented to the street.</p>
<p><strong>Lanes:</strong> Civic Main Streets typically include two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed. Lanes may be dedicated as transit-only or business-access-transit lanes if needed to improve transit speed and reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Width:</strong> Civic Main Streets generally feature a wider right-of-way than Neighborhood Main Streets and are more often able to provide the desired space for each mode and function.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Civic Main Streets should emphasize pedestrian access to adjacent land uses while also accommodating access and mobility for other modes.</p>
<p><strong>Curb zone:</strong> The curb zone along Civic Main Streets should emphasize access and place-making functions (such as parking, loading, transit stops, street trees, curb extensions, and street seats) to support adjacent land use and improve the pedestrian realm. The curb zone may be used for mobility functions if space is needed to provide bicycle facilities or provide turn lanes near intersections.</p>
<p><strong>Separation:</strong> Civic Main Streets have frequent street connections and support multimodal access to destinations. Sidewalks should be provided, and pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be signalized or improved with median refuge islands or curb extensions as needed to provide safety and comfort. Bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Design Elements:</strong> Civic Main Street design should typically include the following: wide sidewalks with a through pedestrian zone, a furnishing zone, and a frontage zone; closely-spaced pedestrian crossings; separated bicycle facilities; way-finding; transit priority treatments as needed; vehicle lanes; low vehicle speeds; medians and/or turn lanes as needed; and limited driveway access.</p>
<p><strong>Design Treatment:</strong> During improvement projects, the preservation of existing vegetation, topography, vistas and viewpoints, driver perception, street lighting, and sight distance requirements should be considered.</p>

<h3 id="urban-throughways">Urban Throughways</h3>
<p>Urban Throughways are designed to emphasize long-distance mobility for motor vehicle, freight, and transit trips throughout the region.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Urban Throughways connect major activity centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Adjacent land uses sometimes orient directly to Urban Throughways.</p>
<p><strong>Lanes:</strong> Urban Throughways usually have four to six vehicle lanes, with additional lanes in some situations. Dedicated high-occupancy-vehicle, freight-only, or transit-only lanes may be provided to support more efficient use of Urban Throughways.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Urban Throughways primarily serve a mobility function, with little or no local access provided along the street.</p>
<p><strong>Separation:</strong> Urban Throughways may be completely divided, with no left turns, or they may be mostly divided, with limited opportunities for left turns. Street connections may occur at separated grades, with access controlled by ramps, or there may be limited street connections at grade. If designed as a grade-separated freeway, pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be provided on overpasses or underpasses, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities along the corridor should be provided on parallel pathways. If designed as a limited-access highway or expressway, pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be either grade-separated or signalized, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Design Elements:</strong> Urban Throughway design typically includes vehicle lanes, grade-separated or signalized pedestrian and bicycle, parallel pathways or separated facilities for pedestrian and bicycle travel, clear sightlines, median barriers, shoulders, and motor vehicle lane widths that accommodate freight movement. Where appropriate, transit priority treatments should be used to enhance transit speed and reliability. Encourage the Oregon Department of Transportation to maintain a continuous landscape along Urban Throughways that reduces the visual impacts of the throughway on motorists and adjacent land uses.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> A ramp that connects to an Urban Throughway is classified as an Urban Throughway up to its intersection with a differently-classified street. An interchange between an Urban Throughway and a differently-classified street should be designed to safely accommodate all modes and provide the least possible disruption to the surrounding modal networks. Connections should be provided across Urban Throughways at closely-spaced intervals to provide greater street connectivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="industrial-roads">Industrial Roads</h3>
<p>Industrial Roads are designed to emphasize freight mobility while also accommodating other modes and providing local access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Industrial Roads typically serve industrial areas and freight intermodal sites, with a significant percentage of trips being made by trucks. Adjacent land uses sometimes orient to the Industrial Road.</p>
<p><strong>Lanes:</strong> Industrial Road design typically includes two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed. Dedicated freight-only lanes or turn pockets may be provided as needed to support roadway efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Industrial Roads emphasize freight mobility while accommodating other modes and providing access to industrial sites and freight districts.</p>
<p><strong>Curb zone:</strong> The curb zone along Industrial Roads primarily serves mobility functions such as vehicle lanes or bike lanes. The curb zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading at limited locations if needed to support adjacent land use.</p>
<p><strong>Separation:</strong> Industrial Roads have limited street connections that may occur at the same grade or separate grades. Pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be grade-separated or signalized, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Design Elements:</strong> Industrial Road design typically includes vehicle lanes, medians or center turn lanes where needed, limited driveway access, pullouts for bus stops, transit priority treatments, separated pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and improved pedestrian crossings located on overpasses, underpasses, or signalized at-grade intersections. Industrial Roads may also include design treatments that improve freight mobility, such as freight-only lanes, freight signal priority, and a wider turning radius at intersections.</p>

<h3 id="enhanced-greenway-corridors">Enhanced Greenway Corridors</h3>
<p>Enhanced Greenway Corridors are designed to provide a network of scenic low-stress connections that prioritize walking and/or bicycling and often include natural features as well as innovative urban design and place-making elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> Streets may have an Enhanced Greenway Corridor classification in addition to another street design classification. When developing or retrofitting these streets, incorporate Enhanced Greenway Corridor design elements within the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Enhanced Greenway Corridors connect parks, open spaces, and singular attractions throughout the City to each other and to surrounding neighborhoods via a network of scenic and low-stress walking and/or bicycling routes. They can run through a variety of different land use contexts, including residential neighborhoods, natural areas, industrial areas, and employment centers.</p>
<p><strong>Design Elements:</strong> Enhanced Greenway Corridor design can take many forms, and should use flexible design treatments appropriate to adjacent land use context. Design elements may include: neighborhood greenways; traffic calming; motor vehicle diversion; multi-use paths; wide sidewalks; boardwalks; trails; separated bikeways; broad-canopy trees and landscaping; scenic views; stormwater management; underground utilities; special lighting; and way-finding. Where appropriate, pedestrian and bicycle routes may use separate parallel routes or streets along a corridor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ ]{.underline}</p>
<h3 id="greenscape-streets">Greenscape Streets</h3>
<p>Greenscape Street designs are applied to arterials where natural or informal landscapes dominate the adjacent areas and the right-of-way, such as lower-density residential areas in wooded settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> Where streets have a Greenscape Street design designation and another street design designation, consider the natural characteristics of the street during the design and implementation of street improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Design Treatment:</strong> During improvement projects, consider the use of vegetated stormwater treatment techniques; minimizing impervious surfaces; preservation of existing vegetation, topography, vistas and viewpoints, driver perception, street lighting, and sight distance requirements. Vegetation may be landscaped or native, depending on the existing and desired character.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-streets">Local Streets</h3>
<p>Local Streets are designed to complement planned land uses and reduce dependence on arterials for local circulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Land Use:</strong> Local Streets are multimodal, but are not intended for trucks (other than local deliveries) in residential areas. Local Streets are important for local circulation of trucks in commercial and industrial areas.</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> Local Street design typically includes frequent street connections, sidewalks, on-street parking, stormwater facilities, and planting of street trees and ground covers (where planting strips are included). A shared street design without sidewalks may be appropriate where traffic volumes are sufficiently low.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as Urban Throughways, Urban Highways, Industrial Roads, Civic Main Streets, Neighborhood Main Streets, Civic Corridors, Neighborhood Corridors, Regional Corridors, or Community Corridors are classified as Local Streets for street design.</p>

<p>Major Emergency Response Streets are intended to serve primarily the longer, most direct legs of emergency response trips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Design treatments on Major Emergency Response Streets should enhance mobility for emergency response vehicles by employing preferential or priority treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Major Emergency Response Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for speed cushions, subject to the approval of Portland Fire and Rescue. Major Emergency Response Streets that also have a District Collector or higher traffic classification are not eligible for traffic slowing devices in the future. Existing speed bumps on Major Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications, subject to the approval of Portland Fire and Rescue. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="secondary-emergency-response-streets">Secondary Emergency Response Streets</h3>
<p>Secondary Emergency Response Streets are intended to provide alternatives to Major Emergency Response Streets in cases when traffic congestion, construction, or other events occur that may cause undue delays in response times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Design treatments on Secondary Emergency Response Streets should enhance mobility for emergency response vehicles by employing preferential or priority treatments, while also allowing for limited traffic slowing treatments to enhance safety and livability.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Secondary Emergency Response Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for speed cushions. Secondary Emergency Response Streets that also have a District Collector or higher traffic classification are not eligible for traffic slowing devices in the future. Existing speed bumps on Secondary Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="minor-emergency-response-streets">Minor Emergency Response Streets</h3>
<p>Minor Emergency Response Streets are intended to serve primarily the shorter legs of emergency response trips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> All streets not classified as Major Emergency Response Streets or Secondary Emergency Response Streets are classified as Minor Emergency Response Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements:</strong> Design and operate Minor Emergency Response Streets to allow access to individual properties by emergency response vehicles, but maintain livability on the street.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Slowing:</strong> Minor Emergency Response Streets are eligible for all types of traffic slowing devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="traffic-classification-descriptions">Traffic Classification Descriptions</h2>
<p>Maintain a system of traffic streets that support the movement of motor vehicles for regional, city, district, neighborhood, and local trips. For each type of traffic classification, the majority of motor vehicle trips on a street should conform to its classification description.</p>
<h3 id="regional-trafficways">Regional Trafficways</h3>
<p>Regional Trafficways are intended to serve regional traffic movement that has only one trip end in a City of Portland transportation district or to serve trips that bypass a district completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Regional Trafficways should make safety the highest priority. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Regional Trafficways to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Regional Trafficways should serve the Central City, regional centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities and should connect key freight routes within the region to points outside the region.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Regional Trafficways should connect to other Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, and District Collectors. A ramp that connects to a Regional Trafficway is classified as a Regional Trafficway from its point of connection up to its intersection with a lower-classified street. At ramps and along access streets, accommodate safe multimodal movements.</p>
<p><strong>Buffering:</strong> Adjacent neighborhoods should be buffered from the impacts of Regional Trafficways.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Classification:</strong> A street with dual Regional Trafficway and Major City Traffic Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major City Traffic Street and respond to adjacent land uses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="major-city-traffic-streets">Major City Traffic Streets</h3>
<p>Major City Traffic Streets are intended to serve as the principal routes for interdistrict traffic that has at least one trip end within a City of Portland transportation district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Major City Traffic Streets. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Major City Traffic Streets to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes for all modes. Major City Traffic Streets should provide separation between motor vehicles and people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices, and provide safe multimodal crossings to destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Major City Traffic Streets should provide motor vehicle connections among the Central City, regional centers, town centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Auto-oriented development should locate adjacent to Major City Traffic Streets, except within designated centers, main streets, station areas, and other areas with high pedestrian demand.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Major City Traffic Streets should serve as primary connections to Regional Trafficways and serve major activity centers in each district. Traffic with no trip ends within a City of Portland transportation district should be discouraged from using Major City Traffic Streets. Where a Major City Traffic Street intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>On-Street Parking:</strong> On-street parking may be removed and additional right-of-way purchased to provide adequate traffic access when consistent with the street design designation of the street. Evaluate the need for on-street parking to serve adjacent land uses and improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists when making changes to the roadway.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="traffic-access-streets">Traffic Access Streets</h3>
<p>Traffic Access Streets are intended to provide access to Central City destinations, distribute traffic within a Central City sub-district, provide connections between Central City subdistricts, and distribute traffic from Regional Trafficways and Major City Traffic Streets for access within the district. Traffic Access Streets are not intended for through-traffic with no trip ends in the district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Traffic Access Streets. Traffic Access Streets should provide frequent, safe crossings for people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Traffic Access Streets serve Central City land uses. Traffic management on Traffic Access Streets must accommodate the high-density pattern desired in the Central City.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Connections to adjoining transportation districts should be to District or Neighborhood Collectors. Intersections of Traffic Access Streets and other streets with higher or similar classifications should be signalized, where warranted, to facilitate the safe movement of traffic along each street as well as turning movements from one street to the other.</p>
<p><strong>Access:</strong> Reduction in motor vehicle congestion is given less priority than: supporting pedestrian access and enhancing the pedestrian environment; maintaining on-street parking to support land uses; accommodating transit; or accommodating bicycles. Access to off-street parking is allowed and encouraged to be located on Traffic Access Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Traffic Access Streets, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="district-collectors">District Collectors</h3>
<p>District Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets to streets of the same or lower classification or to serve trips that both start and end within a district.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on District Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be employed to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> District Collectors generally connect town centers, corridors, main streets, and neighborhoods to nearby regional centers and other major destinations. Land uses that attract trips from the surrounding neighbor­hoods or from throughout the district should be encouraged to locate on District Collectors. Regional attractors of traffic such as major shopping centers or arenas should be discouraged from locating on District Collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> District Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, other collectors, and local streets and, where necessary, to Regional Trafficways. Where a District Collector intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on District Collectors, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="neighborhood-collectors">Neighborhood Collectors</h3>
<p>Neighborhood Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets or District Collectors to Local Service Streets or to serve trips that both start and end within areas bounded by Major City Traffic Streets and District Collectors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Safety should be the highest priority on Neighborhood Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be implemented on Neighborhood Collectors to address identified safety risks. Neighborhood Collectors should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Neighborhood Collectors should connect neighborhoods to nearby centers, corridors, station communities, main streets, and other nearby destinations. New land uses and major expansions of land uses that attract a significant volume of traffic from outside the neighborhood should be discour­aged from locating on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Neighborhood Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, and other Neighborhood Collectors, as well as to Local Service Streets. Where a Neighborhood Collector intersects with a higher-classified street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Calming:</strong> Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability, when consistent with other street classifications.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> The design of Neighborhood Collectors may vary over their length as the land use character changes from primarily commercial to primarily residential. All Neighborhood Collectors should be designed to operate as neighborhood streets and through traffic should be discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Right-of-way acquisition:</strong> Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Neighborhood Collectors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="local-service-traffic-streets">Local Service Traffic Streets</h3>
<p>Local Service Traffic Streets are intended to distribute local traffic and provide access to local residences or commercial uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use/Development:</strong> Discourage auto-oriented land uses from using Local Service Traffic Streets as their primary access.</p>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Streets that allow motor vehicles and are not classified as Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, Traffic Access Streets**,** District Collectors, or Neighborhood Collectors are classified as Local Service Traffic Streets.</p>
<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets should connect neighborhoods, provide local circulation, and provide access to nearby centers, corridors, station areas, and main streets. Street segments may be closed to through traffic in some cases as long as local access and overall neighborhood connectivity is maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Calming:</strong> Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability or if needed to support a neighborhood greenway.</p>
<p><strong>Function:</strong> Local Service Traffic Streets provide local access and circulation for traffic, while often functioning as through routes for pedestrians and bicyclists. In some instances where vehicle speeds and volumes are very low, Local Service Traffic Streets may accommodate vehicles**,** pedestrians**,** and bicyclists in a shared space.</p>

<h4 id="-2"></h4>
<h4 id="access">Access</h4>
<p>The ability to approach or make use of transportation facilities, parks and open space, public</p>
<p>infrastructure, or businesses and services that are open to the public. Good access means within close proximity (up to ó mile) that is free from physical barriers for those with limited mobility.</p>
<h4 id="access-management">Access Management</h4>
<p>Measures regulating access to streets, roads, and highways from public roads and private</p>
<p>driveways. Measures may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the siting of</p>
<p>interchanges, restrictions on the type and amount of access to roadways, and use of physical</p>
<p>controls (such as signals and channelization, including raised medians) to reduce impacts of</p>
<p>approach road traffic on the main facility.</p>
<h4 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h4>
<p>The ability to move easily from one mode of transportation to another mode or to a destination.</p>
<p>Accessibility increases when the number and quality of travel choices increases. Accessibility is</p>
<p>affected by the mix of land uses and the travel alternatives available.</p>
<h4 id="accessway">Accessway</h4>
<p>A type of right-of-way, either public or private, that is primarily to provide pedestrian and</p>
<p>bicycle linkages consistent with connectivity needs, but may be used for vehicle access to</p>
<p>parking or for emergency vehicles. Accessways are typically short in length and are used where</p>
<p>full street connections are not needed and/or are not physically feasible.</p>
<h4 id="active-transportation">Active Transportation</h4>
<p>Transportation that involves physical activity, including walking, biking and using transit.</p>
<h4 id="activity-center">Activity Center</h4>
<p>A cluster of uses that collectively generates many trips (e.g., school and park, neighborhood</p>
<p>commercial district). An activity center can be a single use that generates many trips (e.g.,</p>
<p>stadium, large commercial outlet, large institution).</p>
<h4 id="americans-with-disabilities-act-ada-of-1990">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990</h4>
<p>Civil rights legislation enacted by Congress that mandates the development of a plan to address</p>
<p>discrimination and equal opportunity for disabled persons in employment, transportation,</p>
<p>public accommodation, public services, and telecommunications.</p>
<h4 id="area-permit-parking-program">Area Permit Parking Program</h4>
<p>A Portland Bureau of Transportation program to ensure that on-street parking associated with</p>
<p>commercial, industrial, institutional development or large events will not spill over into adjacent</p>
<p>residential neighborhoods. The program allows residents and firms a limited supply of permits</p>
<p>for on-street parking and restricts on-street parking for other potential users.</p>
<h4 id="arterial">Arterial</h4>
<p>Any street that is not a Local Service Traffic Street according to the traffic classification maps in</p>
<p>the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Arterials include Regional Trafficways,</p>
<p>Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, Neighborhood Collectors, and Traffic Access</p>
<p>Streets.</p>
<p><em>Also:</em> A class of street. Arterial streets interconnect and support the throughway system.</p>
<p>Arterials are intended to provide general mobility for travel within the region. Correctly sized</p>
<p>arterials at appropriate intervals allow through trips to remain on the arterial system thereby</p>
<p>discouraging use of local streets for cut-through travel. Arterial streets link major commercial,</p>
<p>residential, industrial and institutional areas. Major arterials serve longer distance through trips</p>
<p>and serve more of a regional traffic function. Minor arterials serve shorter, more localized travel</p>
<p>within a community. As a result, major arterials usually carry more traffic than minor arterials.</p>
<p>Arterial streets are usually spaced about one mile apart and are designed to accommodate</p>
<p>bicycle, pedestrian, truck and transit travel.</p>
<h4 id="attractor">Attractor</h4>
<p>A use that, by its nature, draws large numbers of people to it for special events or regular</p>
<p>activities. Regional attractors include uses such as sports arenas and convention centers.</p>
<h4 id="auto-oriented-development">Auto-Oriented Development</h4>
<p>Development that is either: 1) auto-related (such as gas stations and auto repair shops) or 2)</p>
<p>auto-accommodating (by its design attracts primarily customers and employees arriving by</p>
<p>automobile, such as drive-in restaurants).</p>
<h4 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h4>
<p>A specific target or goal to be achieved in a specific timeframe. Benchmarks are used to</p>

<p>below).</p>
<h4 id="bicycle">Bicycle</h4>
<p>A vehicle having two tandem wheels, a minimum of 14 inches in diameter, propelled by</p>
<p>human power, upon which a person or persons may ride. A three-wheeled adult tricycle</p>
<p>is considered a bicycle. In Oregon, a bicycle is legally defined as a vehicle. Bicyclists have</p>
<p>the same right to the roadways and must obey the same traffic laws as the operators of</p>
<p>other vehicles.</p>
<h4 id="bicycle-boulevard">Bicycle Boulevard</h4>
<p>See Neighborhood Greenway.</p>
<h4 id="bicyclist">Bicyclist</h4>
<p>Person riding a bicycle.</p>
<h4 id="bike-share">Bike Share</h4>

<p>lease of vehicles, fuel costs, maintenance and repair costs is borne by the organization.</p>
<h4 id="centers">Centers</h4>
<p>Places with concentrations of commercial and community services, housing, gathering places,</p>
<p>and transit connections. Centers provide services to surrounding neighborhoods and are</p>
<p>intended to be enhanced as places because they are a focus of housing and job growth. There are four types of centers with varying functions, levels of activity, and scales and intensities of</p>
<p>development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central City: Corresponds to the Central City plan district, which serves as the region’s</li>
</ul>
<p>premier center, anchoring an interconnected system of centers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gateway Regional Center: Corresponds to the Gateway plan district, East Portland’s largest center, which is intended to be enhanced as an employment and community service hub within the area and region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Town Centers: Large centers that serve a broad area of the city and have an important role in accommodating growth. They provide a full range of commercial and community services, high-density housing, mid-rise commercial and mid-rise mixed-use buildings (typically up to five to seven stories in height), are served by high-capacity transit connections, and have a substantial employment component. Town Centers provide housing opportunities for enough population to support a full-service business district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Centers: Centers that primarily serve adjacent neighborhoods and provide</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>opportunities for additional housing and low- to mid-rise commercial and mixed-use</p>

<h4 id="collector-of-regional-significance">Collector of Regional Significance</h4>
<p>As designated in the 2000 Regional Transportation Plan, a route that connects the regional</p>
<p>arterial system and the local system by collecting and distributing neighborhood traffic to</p>
<p>arterial streets. Collectors of regional significance have three purposes: 1) They ensure adequate access to the primary and secondary land use components of the 2040 Growth Concept; 2) They allow dispersion of arterial traffic over a number of lesser facilities where an adequate local network exists; 3) They help define appropriate collector level movement between jurisdictions. (Source: 2000 RTP)</p>
<h4 id="collector-street">Collector street</h4>
<p>A class of street. Collector streets provide both access and circulation between residential,</p>
<p>commercial, industrial and agricultural community areas and the arterial system. As such,</p>
<p>collectors tend to carry fewer motor vehicles than arterial streets, with reduced travel speeds.</p>
<p>Collector streets are usually spaced at half-mile intervals, midway between arterial streets.</p>
<p>Collectors may serve as bike, pedestrian and freight access routes, providing local connections to the arterial street network and transit system. While the focus for collectors has been on motor vehicle traffic, they are developed as multi-modal facilities that accommodate bicycles,</p>
<p>pedestrians and transit.</p>
<h4 id="complete-streets">Complete Streets</h4>
<p>Complete streets provide accessibility to all users of the right-of-way regardless of age, ability, or mode of transportation. They are designed and operated to make better places and to enhance safe access for all modes, including people walking and bicycling, those using a mobility device, motorists, and transit users.</p>
<h4 id="community-uses">Community Uses</h4>

<h4 id="corridor">Corridor</h4>
<p>1. Corridors (2040 design type) – A type of land use that is typically located along regional transit routes and arterial streets, providing a place for somewhat higher densities than is found in 2040 centers. These land uses should feature a high-quality pedestrian environment and</p>
<p>convenient access to transit. Typical new developments would include rowhouses, duplexes and one to three-story office and retail buildings, and average about 25 persons per acre. While some corridors may be continuous, narrow bands of higher-intensity development along arterial</p>
<p>streets, others may be more nodal, that is a series of smaller centers at major intersections or</p>
<p>other locations along the arterial that have high quality pedestrian environments, good</p>
<p>connection to adjacent neighborhoods and transit service.</p>
<p>2. Corridor as defined in the Comprehensive Plan is an area that may be a single major street, or a broad mobility corridor that provides connections for a range of transportation modes (transit, pedestrians, cyclists, freight, motor vehicles, and so forth), not necessarily on the same street. There are three types of corridor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Civic Corridor: These are a prioritized subset of the city’s most prominent transit and transportation streets. They connect centers, provide regional connections, and include segments where commercial development and housing are focused. Civic Corridors are intended to continue their important transportation functions while providing livable environments for people, and evolving into distinctive places that are models of ecological design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neighborhood Corridor: Main streets that connect neighborhoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They support neighborhood business districts and provide housing opportunities close to local services, amenities, and transit lines. They are streets that include a mix of commercial and higher-density housing development. They have less intense development and transportation function than Civic Corridors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freight Corridor: Primary routes into and through the city that support Portland as an important West Coast hub and a gateway for international and domestic trade. These facilities are integral to the growth of traded sector businesses such as manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution industries.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="transportation-disadvantaged">Transportation Disadvantaged</h4>
<p>Individuals who have difficulty obtaining transportation because of their age, income, disability,</p>
<p>or who are transit dependent for other reasons.</p>
<h4 id="transportation-district">Transportation District</h4>
<p>For TSP purposes, one of the eight Transportation Districts identified: Central City, North,</p>
<p>Northeast, Far Northeast, Southeast, Far Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest.</p>
<h4 id="transportation-facilities">Transportation Facilities</h4>
<p>Any physical facility that moves or assists in the movement of people or goods, but excluding</p>

<h4 id="transportation-management-association-tma">Transportation Management Association (TMA)</h4>
<p>Groups of businesses or institutions that develop TDM measures in order to reduce the need for</p>
<p>commuter and visitor parking. Measures may include carpool-matching services, transit</p>
<p>subsidies, shuttle vans, or encouraging alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<h4 id="transportation-planning-rule-tpr">Transportation Planning Rule (TPR)</h4>
<p>The implementing rule of Statewide Planning Goal 12 dealing with transportation, as adopted by</p>
<p>the State Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC). Among its provisions, the</p>
<p>TPR requires reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 15 percent in the next 30</p>
<p>years, reducing parking spaces per capita by 10 percent in the next 20 years, and improving</p>
<p>opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.</p>
<h4 id="transportation-system-management-tsm">Transportation System Management (TSM)</h4>
<p>Strategies and techniques for increasing the efficiency, safety, or level-of-service of a</p>
<p>transportation facility without increasing its size. Examples include, but are not limited to,</p>
<p>traffic signal improvements, traffic control devices (including installing medians,</p>
<p>channelization, access management, and ramp metering), incident response, targeted traffic</p>
<p>enforcement, preferential transit measures, and restriping for high-occupancy vehicle lanes.</p>
<h4 id="transportation-system-plan-tsp">Transportation System Plan (TSP)</h4>
<p>A plan for one or more transportation facilities that are planned, developed, operated, and</p>
<p>maintained in a coordinated manner to supply continuity of movement between modes and</p>
<p>within and between geographical and jurisdictional areas.</p>
<h4 id="trimet">TriMet</h4>
<p>Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District, the transit agency for most of Clackamas,</p>
<p>Multnomah, and Washington Counties.</p>
<h4 id="trip">Trip</h4>
<p>A journey made by any mode between an origin and a destination. Trips can be categorized as</p>
<p>follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regional trip – A trip that has neither trip origin nor destination within the Portland metro\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>area.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interregional trip – A trip that has one trip end within the Portland region and the other trip end outside the Portland region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interdistrict trip – A trip that starts in one Transportation District and ends in another\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transportation District.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intradistrict trip – A trip that starts and ends within the same Transportation District.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-local trip --A trip that extends beyond the length of the functional purpose described in a street’s classification description.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="trip-end">Trip End</h4>
<p>The origin or destination point of a journey.</p>
<h4 id="urban-growth-management-functional-plan-ugmfp">Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP)</h4>
<p>A regional functional plan with requirements binding on cities and counties in the Metro region,</p>
<p>as mandated by Metro’s Regional Framework Plan. The plan addresses accommodation of</p>
<p>projected regional population and job growth, regional parking management, water quality</p>
<p>conservation, and limits on retail uses in employment and industrial areas.</p>
<h4 id="volume-to-capacity-vc-ratio"><strong>Volume-to-capacity (v/c) Ratio</strong></h4>
<p>A measure of potential roadway capacity. A ratio expressing the relationship between the</p>
<p>existing or anticipated volume of traffic on a roadway and the designed capacity of the facility.</p>
<h4 id="vehicle-miles-traveled-vmt-per-capita">Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) per Capita</h4>
<p>Miles driven in automobiles per person on average. The Transportation Planning Rule requires</p>
<p>a 10 percent reduction of VMT per capita within 20 years of adoption of a Transportation</p>
<p>System Plan, and an additional 5 percent reduction within 30 years of adoption of the TSP. The</p>
<p>VMT per capita reductions mean that individuals will, on average, travel less by automobile than</p>
<p>previously but, because the population will continue to grow, it does not mean an overall</p>
<p>reduction in the amount of miles driven.</p>
