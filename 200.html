            <h2>Transportation Policies</h2>
            <h3>Design and planning</h3>
            <p>The City of Portland’s transportation system is a key public facility. The following policies describe what the transportation system is, what it does, and what factors to consider in how the overall system is used. </p>
            <p><em>Policies 8.1-8.60 in Chapter 8: Public Facilities and Services also apply to the need for quality facilities and services, multiple benefits, reliability, and creating a multi-purpose and safe right-of-way.</em> </p>
            <h6>Policy 9.1</h6>
            <p><strong>Street design classifications.</strong> Maintain and implement street design classifications consistent with land use plans, environmental context, urban design pattern areas, and the Neighborhood Corridor and Civic Corridor Urban Design Framework designations. </p>
            <h6>Policy 9.2</h6>
            <p><strong>Street policy classifications.</strong> Maintain and implement street policy classifications for pedestrian, bicycle, transit, freight, emergency vehicle, and automotive movement, while considering access for all modes, connectivity, adjacent planned land uses, and state and regional requirements. </p>
            <h6>9.2.a</h6>
            <p>Designate district classifications that emphasize freight mobility and access in industrial and employment areas serving high levels of truck traffic and to accommodate the needs of intermodal freight movement.</p>
            <h6>9.2.b</h6>
            <p>Designate district classifications that give priority to pedestrian access in areas where high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned, including the Central City, Gateway regional center, town centers, neighborhood centers, and transit station areas.</p>
            <h6>9.2.c</h6>
            <p>Designate district classifications that give priority to bicycle access and mobility in areas where high levels of bicycle activity exist or are planned, including Downtown, the River District, Lloyd District, Gateway Regional Center, town centers, neighborhood centers, and transit station areas.</p>
            <h6>Policy 9.3</h6>
            <p><strong>Transportation System Plan.</strong> Maintain and implement the Transportation System Plan (TSP) as the decision-making tool for transportation-related projects, policies, programs, and street design.</p>
            <h6>Policy 9.4</h6>
            <p><strong>Use of classifications.</strong> Plan, develop, implement, and manage the transportation system in accordance with street design and policy classifications outlined in the Transportation System Plan.</p>
            <h6>Policy 9.5</h6>
            <p><strong>Mode share goals and Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) reduction.</strong> Increase the share of trips made using active and low-carbon transportation modes. Reduce VMT to achieve targets set in the most current Climate Action Plan and Transportation System Plan, and meet or exceed Metro’s mode share and VMT targets. </p>
            <h6>Policy 9.6</h6>
            <p><strong>Transportation strategy for people movement.</strong> Implement a prioritization of modes for people movement by making transportation system decisions according to the following ordered list: </p>
            <ol><li>Walking</li>
            <li>Bicycling </li>
            <li>Transit </li>
            <li>Taxi / commercial transit / shared vehicles </li>
            <li>Zero emission vehicles</li>
            <li>Other single-occupant vehicles</li>
            </ol><p>When implementing this prioritization, ensure that:</p>
            <ol><li>The needs and safety of each group of users are considered, and changes do not make existing conditions worse for the most vulnerable users higher on the ordered list. </li>
            <li>All users’ needs are balanced with the intent of optimizing the right of way for multiple modes on the same street.</li>
            <li>When necessary to ensure safety, accommodate some users on parallel streets as part of a multi-street corridor.</li>
            <li>Land use and system plans, network functionality for all modes, other street functions, and complete street policies, are maintained.</li>
            <li>Policy-based rationale is provided if modes lower in the ordered list are prioritized.</li>
            </ol><p><em>Specific modal policies are found below in policies 9.17 to 9.40.</em></p>
            <h6>Policy 9.7</h6>
            <p><strong>Moving goods and delivering services.</strong> In tandem with people movement, maintain efficient and reliable movement of goods and services as a critical transportation system function. Prioritize freight system reliability improvements over single-occupancy vehicle mobility where there are solutions that distinctly address those different needs. <em>Multimodal freight policies are found below in policies 9.33 to 9.35.</em></p>
            <h6>Policy 9.8</h6>
            <p><strong>Affordability.</strong> Improve and maintain the transportation system to increase access to convenient and affordable transportation options for all Portlanders, especially those who have traditionally been under-served or under-represented or have historically borne unequal burdens. </p>
            <h6>Policy 9.9</h6>
            <p><strong>Accessible and age-friendly transportation system.</strong> Ensure that transportation facilities are accessible to people of all ages and abilities, and that all improvements to the transportation system (traffic, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian) in the public right-of-way comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Improve and adapt the transportation system to better meet the needs of the most vulnerable users, including the young, older adults, and people with different abilities.</p>
            <h6>Policy 9.10</h6>
            <p><strong>Geographic policies.</strong> Adopt geographically-specific policies in the Transportation System Plan to ensure that transportation infrastructure reflects the unique topography, historic character, natural features, system gaps, economic needs, demographics, and land uses of each area. Use the Pattern Areas identified in Chapter 3: Urban Form as the basis for area policies. </p>
            <h3>Land use, development, and placemaking</h3>
            <p>Land use patterns and connections among different land uses are key elements defining the form and character of places. In tandem with Chapter 3: Urban Form and Chapter 4: Design and Development, the policies in this section give direction for designing and building a transportation system that supports, complements, and meets the needs of different places. These policies acknowledge development adjacent to transportation as a critical component in shaping the future of Portland’s public spaces and places. </p>
            <h6>Policy 9.11</h6>
            <p><strong>Land use and transportation coordination.</strong> Implement the Comprehensive Plan Map and the Urban Design Framework though coordinated long-range transportation and land use planning. Ensure that street policy and design classifications and land uses complement one another.</p>
            <h6>Policy 9.12</h6>
            <p><strong>Growth strategy.</strong> Use street design and policy classifications to support Goals 3A-3G in Chapter 3: Urban Form. Consider the different design contexts and transportation functions in Town Centers, Neighborhood Centers, Neighborhood Corridors, Employment Areas, Freight Corridors, Civic Corridors, Transit Station Areas, and Greenways.</p>
            <h6>Policy 9.13</h6>
            <p><strong>Development and street design.</strong> Evaluate adjacent land uses to help inform street classifications in framing, shaping, and activating the public space of streets. Guide development and land use to create the kinds of places and street environments intended for different types of streets.</p>
            <h4>Streets as public spaces</h4>
            <p>Streets, including sidewalks and planting strips, provide critical transportation and utility functions. In Portland, streets are the most abundant type of public space, occupying nearly 20 percent of land area in the city. The following policies support community desire to expand the use of streets beyond their transportation functions. <em>See Chapter 8: Public Facilities and Services and Chapter 4: Design and Development for further use and streetscape policies.</em></p>
            <h6>Policy 9.14</h6>
            <p><strong>Streets for transportation and public spaces.</strong> Integrate both placemaking and transportation functions when designing and managing streets by encouraging design, development, and operation of streets to enhance opportunities for them to serve as places for community interaction, environmental function, open space, tree canopy, recreation, and other community purposes. </p>
            <h6>Policy 9.15</h6>
            <p><strong>Repurposing street space.</strong> Encourage repurposing street segments that are not critical for transportation connectivity to other community purposes.</p>
            <h6>Policy 9.16</h6>
            <p><strong>Design with nature.</strong> Promote street and trail alignments and designs that respond to topography and natural features, when feasible, and protect streams, wildlife habitat, and native trees. </p>
            <h4>Modal policies</h4>
            <p>Portland is committed to providing a multimodal transportation system that offers affordable and convenient travel options within the city, region, and outside the Metro area. Because trips are made for different reasons, they vary in length and type of vehicle (mode) needed to make them. Different modes create different kinds of impacts — on neighborhood livability and carbon emissions, for example. These policies recognize that some modes are more appropriate than others for different types of trips.</p>
