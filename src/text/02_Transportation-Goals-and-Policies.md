5.  Other shared vehicles

6.  Low or no occupancy vehicles, fossil-fueled non-transit vehicles

*When implementing this prioritization, ensure that:*

-   *The needs and safety of each group of users are considered, and
    > changes do not make existing conditions worse for the most
    > vulnerable users higher on the ordered list.*

-   *All users' needs are balanced with the intent of optimizing the
    > right of way for multiple modes on the same street.*

-   *When necessary to ensure safety, accommodate some users on parallel
    > streets as part of a multi-street corridor.*

-   *Land use and system plans, network functionality for all modes,
    > other street functions, and complete street policies, are
    > maintained.*

-   *Policy-based rationale is provided if modes lower in the ordered
    > list are prioritized. (CP Policy 9.6)*

*\*The demand-to-capacity ratios in the table are for the highest two
consecutive hours of the weekday traffic volumes. The mid-day peak hour
is the highest 60-minute period between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
The 2nd hour is defined as the single 60-minute period, either before or
after the peak 60-minute period, whichever is highest.*

**Multimodal Mixed-Use Area:** Designate a Central City Multimodal
Mixed-Use Area (MMA) in the geography indicated in Figure 9‐2, which
will render state congestion / mobility standards inapplicable to
proposed plan amendments under OAR 660-0012-0060(10), subject to ODOT
concurrence and execution of an agreement between ODOT and the City of
Portland. The agreement should emphasize potential safety and
operational impacts. (CP Policy 9.51)

**Transportation demand management (TDM) policies**

*~~Providing residents and employees information and incentives to walk,
bicycle, use transit, and otherwise reduce the need to own and use
private vehicles can be one of the quickest, least expensive, and most
effective strategies to achieve City goals and to prevent traffic and
parking impacts. Transportation and parking demand management (TDM)
programs can cost-effectively increase the modal share of walking,
bicycling, and shared vehicle trips.~~*

**Outreach:** Create and maintain TDM outreach programs that work with
Transportation Management Associations (TMA), residents, employers, and
employees that increase the modal share of walking, bicycling, and
shared vehicle trips while reducing private vehicle ownership, parking
demand, and drive-alone trips, especially during peak periods. (CP
Policy 9.52)

**New development:** Create and maintain TDM regulations and services
that prevent and reduce traffic and parking impacts from new development
and redevelopment. Encourage coordinated area-wide delivery of TDM
programs. Monitor and improve the performance of private-sector TDM
programs. (CP Policy 9.53)

*Note: TDM implementation strategies will reviewed and modified based on
TDM process, Code and Admin Rule under development.*

**Projects and programs:** Integrate TDM information into transportation
project and program development and implementation to increase use of
new multimodal transportation projects and services. (CP Policy 9.54)

**Parking management policies**

~~Vibrant urban places link people and activities. As Portland grows, we
must manage both the demand and supply of parking to achieve climate,
health, livability, and prosperity goals. Providing too much and/or
underpriced parking can lead to more driving and less walking, cycling,
and transit use; inefficient land use patterns; and sprawl. Insufficient
parking can negatively affect neighborhood livability and economic
vitality. These policies provide guidance to manage parking demand and
supply to meet a variety of public objectives, including achieving
compact walkable communities, reducing private vehicle ownership and
overall vehicle use, enhancing livability, reducing pollution, and
expanding economic opportunity.~~

**Parking management:** Reduce parking demand and manage supply to
improve pedestrian, bicycle and transit mode share, neighborhood
livability, safety, business district vitality, vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) reduction, and air quality. Implement strategies that reduce
demand for new parking and private vehicle ownership, and that help
maintain optimal parking occupancy and availability. (CP Policy 9.55)

**Curb Zone:** Recognize that the Curb Zone is a public space, a
physical and spatial asset that has value and cost. Evaluate whether,
when, and where parking is the highest and best use of this public space
in support of broad City policy goals and local land use context.
Establish thresholds to utilize parking management and pricing tools in
areas with high parking demand to ensure adequate on-street parking
supply during peak periods. (CP Policy 9.56)

**On-street parking:** Manage parking and loading demand, supply, and
operations in the public right of way to achieve mode share objectives,
and to encourage safety, economic vitality, and livability. Use
transportation demand management and pricing of parking in areas with
high parking demand. (CP Policy 9.57)

**Off-street parking:** Limit the development of new parking spaces to
achieve land use, transportation, and environmental goals, especially in
locations with frequent transit service. Regulate off-street parking to
achieve mode share objectives, promote compact and walkable urban form,
encourage lower rates of car ownership, and promote the vitality of
commercial and employment areas. Use transportation demand management
and pricing of parking in areas with high parking demand. Strive to
provide adequate but not excessive off-street parking where needed,
consistent with the preceding practices. (CP Policy 9.58)

**Share space and resources:** Encourage the shared use of parking and
vehicles to maximize the efficient use of limited urban space. (CP
Policy 9.59)

**Cost and price:** Recognize the high public and private cost of
parking by encouraging prices that reflect the cost of providing parking
and balance demand and supply. Discourage employee and resident parking
subsidies. (CP Policy 9.60)

**Bicycle parking:** Promote the development of new bicycle parking
facilities including dedicated bike parking in the public right-of-way.
Provide sufficient bicycle parking at high-capacity transit stations to
enhance bicycle connection opportunities. Require provision of adequate
off-street bicycle parking for new development and redevelopment.
Encourage the provision of parking for different types of bicycles. In
establishing the standards for long-term bicycle parking, consider the
needs of persons with different levels of ability. (CP Policy 9.61)

**Finance, programs, and coordination policies**

**Coordination:** Coordinate with state and federal agencies, local and
regional governments, special districts, other City bureaus, and
providers of transportation services when planning for, developing, and
funding transportation facilities and services. (CP Policy 9.62)

**New development impacts:** Prevent, reduce, and mitigate the impacts
of new development and redevelopment on the transportation system.
Utilize strategies including transportation and parking demand
management, transportation system analysis, and system and local impact
mitigation improvements and fees. (CP Policy 9.63)

**Education and encouragement:** Create, maintain, and coordinate
educational and encouragement programs that support multimodal
transportation and that emphasize safety for all modes of
transportation. Ensure that these programs are accessible to
historically underserved and underrepresented populations. (CP Policy
9.64)

**Telecommuting:** Promote telecommuting and the use of communications
technology to reduce travel demand. (CP Policy 9.65)

**Project and program selection criteria:** Establish transportation
project and program selection criteria consistent with
\[Transportation\] goals 9A through 9I, to cost-effectively achieve
access, placemaking, sustainability, equity, health, prosperity, and
safety goals. (CP Policy 9.66)

**Funding:** Encourage the development of a range of stable
transportation funding sources that provide adequate resources to build
and maintain an equitable and sustainable transportation system. (CP
Policy 9.67)
