This is achieved by encouraging people through education, outreach, incentives and pricing to choose other modes, share rides, travel outside peak times, and telecommute, among other methods. TDM program elements include SmartTrips outreach, TDM Plan requirements for new development, and parking management planning and implementation.   TDM is often implemented in partnerships with community organizations, neighborhood and business assocations, developers and property managers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | $19,500,000      | Yes                        | Years 1 - 20        |  |

Unimproved and substandard streets cause safety, access and mobility issues for all users and fail to manage stormwater runoff. The Alternative Street Design Program will plan and implement lower-cost alternative design treatments that enhance safety, access, and mobility when funds are lacking for more extensive upgrades. Ideally, these design treatments would be concurrent with stormwater improvements. Example projects include “shared street” improvements to gravel streets, new connections through undeveloped rights-of-way, and improvements to substandard paved streets.  The program could be funded by a combination of Local Improvement Districts, development impact fees, local transportation funds (e.g. Our Streets), Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) stormwater funds, and other grant and community investment opportunities. | $20,000,000      | Yes                        | Years 1 - 20        |  |
