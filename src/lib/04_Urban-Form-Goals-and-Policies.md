Pattern Areas

Portland has five distinct Pattern Areas. The development patterns and characteristics of these areas are influenced by the natural landscape and how and when these parts of the city were developed.

1.  **Rivers**

2.  **Central City**

3.  **Inner Neighborhoods**

4.  **Western Neighborhoods**

5.  **Eastern Neighborhoods**

Each Pattern Area has unique physical, social, cultural, and environmental qualities that differentiate them and create their sense of place. To maintain and enhance the positive qualities and sense of place in each pattern area, it is desirable to have policies and regulations that respond to each area's unique natural and built assets.

The following policies identify key positive characteristics of each of Portland's Pattern Areas that are relevant to decisions related to future development in these areas.
