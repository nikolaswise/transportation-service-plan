Introduction
============

Portland is projected to add 140,000 new jobs and 260,000 new residents over the next 20 years. As Portland and the region grow, however, there is a continuing challenge to maintain the natural environment, economic prosperity, and overall quality of life. If in 2035 the percentage of people who drive alone to work remains the same as it is now (nearly 60 percent), traffic, carbon emissions, and household spending on vehicles and fuel will all worsen significantly. In order to accommodate this growth, our transportation system must provide Portlanders safer and more convenient ways to walk, bike, and take transit for more trips. The 2035 Transportation System Plan guides investments to maintain and improve the livability of Portland by:

-   supporting the City's commitment to Vision Zero by saving lives and reducing injuries to all people using our transportation system

-   limiting traffic congestion so transit and freight vehicles can move more reliably

-   reducing, carbon emissions and promoting healthy lifestyles

-   keeping more money in the local economy, as we spend less on vehicles and fuel

-   creating great places

The Transportation System Plan is the 20-year plan to guide transportation policies and investments in Portland. The TSP meets state and regional planning requirements and addresses local transportation needs. Transportation planning that promotes active transportation modes is essential to preserving the City's livability and for the protection of the natural environment. Constructing significant amounts of new automobile capacity to accommodate growth is not a viable option because of the enormous costs and impacts. Adding more streets and parking lots divides neighborhoods, uses valuable land, encourages urban sprawl, and has negative environmental impacts. Alternative approaches, supporting a safer, more affordable and more complete multimodal transportation network must be used to ensure integrated, comprehensive solutions. The first TSP was adopted by Council in 2002 (Ordinance 177028).

The Transportation System Plan helps implement the City's 2035 Comprehensive Plan in addition to the region's 2040 Growth Concept by supporting a transportation system that makes it more convenient for people to walk, bicycle, use transit, and drive less to meet their daily needs. The TSP also recognizes that the transportation system must help grow and sustain the City's economic health by accommodating the needs of businesses and supporting Portland's role in the international economy.

**The 2035 TSP includes:**

-   Goals and policies that guide the maintenance, development and implementation of Portland's transportation system

-   Objectives that further the implementation of the goals and policies

-   A list of projects and City wide programs along with a financial plan that would accommodate 20 years of population and employment growth

-   Master street plans and modal plans

-   Strategies and regulations for implementation, including street classifications

Elements of the TSP
-------------------

The goals and policies, street classification descriptions and maps, the financial plan and the master street plan maps in the TSP were adopted as part of the Comprehensive Plan by City Council in 2016. The TSP was adopted concurrently with the Comprehensive Plan, but published under a separate cover. Stage 3 Update will be adopted separately from the Comp Plan and Stages 1 and 2, then incorporated into one TSP document.

The TSP is both an implementation tool and a supporting document to the Comprehensive Plan. It contains the transportation element of the City's Public Facilities Plan, and the List of Significant Projects and Citywide Programs. The TSP also provides more detail than the Comprehensive Plan by including additional supporting information about transportation system conditions.

Transportation System Plan Updates
----------------------------------

In order to keep the TSP current and up-to-date with recent transportation planning and development activities, it is updated at regular intervals. The first two updates in the mid-2000s were not intended to include new policy initiatives. They were primarily technical in nature and included corrections, updates to project descriptions, updates on studies, and inclusion of new master street plans adopted as a part of planning efforts.

The first update was completed and adopted by City Council on October 13, 2004 (effective date, November 12, 2004; Ordinance Nos. 178815 and 178826).

The second update was completed and adopted by City Council on April 5, 2007 (effective date, May 5, 2007; Ordinance No 180871). While primarily technical in nature, this update also included new policy language to implement the City's Green Street Policy.

Stage 1 TSP Update was a part of the City's Comprehensive Plan update process and a component of the state's Periodic Work Plan Task 4. It included Goals, Policies, Projects and Programs and a Financial Plan. It was adopted by City Council in June 2016.

The Stage 2 TSP Update was a part of the City's Comprehensive Plan update and changes were made to implement the Comp Plan, as well as reflect adopted plans and classification changes since the last update in 2007. Periodic Work Plan Task 5 was adopted by City Council in December 2016.

TSP Stage 3 TSP Update is incorporating regional information, updating geographic policies and objectives, updating objectives, adding a few policies, changes to street classification for traffic, transit and emergency response, modal plans, and other changes as identified. There is also parallel staff process to reformat the document and create a new user friendly digital document.

Regulatory Framework
--------------------

The TSP addresses and complies with a number of State and regional goals, policies, and regulations, as summarized below.

State of Oregon

*Statewide Planning Goals*

Oregon has 19 goals that provide a foundation for the State's land use planning program. The TSP must comply with all applicable State goals. The two goals directly applicable to the TSP are Goal 11: Public Facilities Plan and Goal 12: Transportation.

*Transportation Planning Rule*

The Transportation Planning Rule (TPR) implements statewide planning Goal 12: Transportation. The TPR requires State, regional, and local jurisdictions to develop Transportation System Plans (TSPs) that comply with TPR provisions. These provisions include reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 10 percent over the next 20 years, reducing parking spaces per capita, and improving opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.

*Oregon Transportation Plan*

The Oregon Transportation Plan (OTP) serves as the State's TSP. Regional and local TSPs must be consistent with the OTP.

Regional Metro

*Regional Transportation Plan*

First adopted by Metro in 1983, with latest update in 2014, the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) serves as the regional TSP. As such, the RTP:

-   Is consistent with the requirements of the State TPR and OTP

-   Implements the 2040 Growth Concept and Regional Framework Plan

-   Focuses on the regional transportation system

-   Includes multimodal functional classifications and street design classifications

-   Includes a list of major system improvements

-   Includes a funding plan

As of August 2017 Metro and regional partners are updating the RTP with a new RTP to be issued in 2018.

*Region 2040 Growth Concept*

Metro adopted the 2040 Growth Concept as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. The 2040 Growth Concept stated the preferred form of long-term regional growth and development, including the urban growth boundary (UGB), density, and open space protection. It also designates design types, such as central city, regional center, town center, and main street.

*Regional Transportation Functional Plan*

The Regional Transportation Functional Plan (first adopted in 2010, last updated in 2012; Ordinance No 10-1241B) implements the Goals and Objectives in section 2.3 of the RTP and the policies of the RTP, and replaces the regional parking policy of the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (See RTFP Title 4: Regional Parking Management.) It provides policy basis and direction for local TSPs. The RTFP codifies requirements that local plans must comply with to be consistent with the Regional Transportation Plan. Therefore, its requirements are binding on cities and counties.

*Urban Growth Management Functional Plan*

Metro adopted the Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP) in 1996 and updated it 2014 to implement regional goals and objectives adopted by the Metro Council as the Regional Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGO), including the 2040 Growth Concept and the Regional Framework Plan. The UGMFP addresses the accommodation of regional population and job growth. Its requirements are binding on cities and counties.

*Regional Framework Plan*

The Regional Framework Plan, adopted in 1997, identifies regional policies to implement the 2040 Growth Concept, preserving access to nature and building great communities for today and the future. The plan was amended in 2005 and 2010, and again in 2014 as part of the adoption of the Climate Smart Strategy.

City of Portland

*Comprehensive Plan*

Portland's 2035 Comprehensive Plan guides land use development and public facility investment decisions between now and 2035. This guidance is intended to help make Portland more prosperous, healthy, equitable and resilient.

Seven Outcomes
--------------

Working with our partners at Metro, the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, and the Oregon Department of Transportation, with direction from the Portland Plan (2012), the Climate Action Plan (2010), Health Equity & the Transportation System Plan Report (2012), and from the Comprehensive Plan Update, PBOT staff developed an outcome based approach to the TSP.

These seven outcomes directed policy choices as well as informed the development of criteria for selecting and prioritizing TSP Projects and Programs. The Transportation System Improvements Chapter contains details on the citywide project and programs process and evaluation.

These seven outcomes are:

1.  Reduce/eliminate transportation fatalities and injuries

2.  Improve access to daily needs, such as jobs, schools, grocery stores, and health care

3.  Improve health by increasing walking and bicycling

4.  Increase economic benefits, such as access to family wage jobs and freight access

5.  Ensure disadvantaged communities benefit as much or more than non-disadvantaged communities

6.  Reduce global warming pollution from transportation

7.  Prioritize the most cost-effective projects
