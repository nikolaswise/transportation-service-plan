Glossary
========

The Transportation System Plan uses clear, everyday language as much as possible. Words and terms in the Glossary have the specific meaning stated below when used in the Comprehensive Plan and TSP, unless the context clearly indicates another meaning. Words not included in this Glossary are defined by their dictionary meaning, or in some cases, by their meaning in state or federal law.

**2040 Growth Concept**

A concept for the long-term growth management of our region, developed by Metro. It describes the preferred form of regional growth, including where growth should be clustered, what the appropriate densities are for various land use design types, and which areas should be protected as open space. The 2040 Growth Concept was adopted as part of the Regional Urban Growth Goals and Objectives (RUGGOs) in 1995. (Source: 2000 RTP)

**Access**

The ability to approach or make use of transportation facilities, parks and open space, public infrastructure, or businesses and services that are open to the public. Good access means within close proximity (up to รณ mile) that is free from physical barriers for those with limited mobility.

**Access Management**

Measures regulating access to streets, roads, and highways from public roads and private driveways. Measures may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the siting of interchanges, restrictions on the type and amount of access to roadways, and use of physical controls (such as signals and channelization, including raised medians) to reduce impacts of approach road traffic on the main facility.

**Accessibility**

The ability to move easily from one mode of transportation to another mode or to a destination. Accessibility increases when the number and quality of travel choices increases. Accessibility is affected by the mix of land uses and the travel alternatives available.

**Accessway**

A type of right-of-way, either public or private, that is primarily to provide pedestrian and bicycle linkages consistent with connectivity needs, but may be used for vehicle access to parking or for emergency vehicles. Accessways are typically short in length and are used where full street connections are not needed and/or are not physically feasible.

**Active Transportation**

Transportation that involves physical activity, including walking, biking and using transit.

**Activity Center**

A cluster of uses that collectively generates many trips (e.g., school and park, neighborhood commercial district). An activity center can be a single use that generates many trips (e.g., stadium, large commercial outlet, large institution).

**Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990**

Civil rights legislation enacted by Congress that mandates the development of a plan to address discrimination and equal opportunity for disabled persons in employment, transportation, public accommodation, public services, and telecommunications.

**Area Permit Parking Program**

A Portland Bureau of Transportation program to ensure that on-street parking associated with commercial, industrial, institutional development or large events will not spill over into adjacent residential neighborhoods. The program allows residents and firms a limited supply of permits for on-street parking and restricts on-street parking for other potential users.

**Arterial**

Any street that is not a Local Service Traffic Street according to the traffic classification maps in the Transportation Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Arterials include Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, Neighborhood Collectors, and Traffic Access Streets.

*Also:* A class of street. Arterial streets interconnect and support the throughway system. Arterials are intended to provide general mobility for travel within the region. Correctly sized arterials at appropriate intervals allow through trips to remain on the arterial system thereby discouraging use of local streets for cut-through travel. Arterial streets link major commercial, residential, industrial and institutional areas. Major arterials serve longer distance through trips and serve more of a regional traffic function. Minor arterials serve shorter, more localized travel within a community. As a result, major arterials usually carry more traffic than minor arterials. Arterial streets are usually spaced about one mile apart and are designed to accommodate bicycle, pedestrian, truck and transit travel.

**Attractor**

A use that, by its nature, draws large numbers of people to it for special events or regular activities. Regional attractors include uses such as sports arenas and convention centers.

**Auto-Oriented Development**

Development that is either: 1) auto-related (such as gas stations and auto repair shops) or 2) auto-accommodating (by its design attracts primarily customers and employees arriving by automobile, such as drive-in restaurants).

**Benchmark**

A specific target or goal to be achieved in a specific timeframe. Benchmarks are used to determine the attainment of performance indicators and performance measures (defined below).

**Bicycle**

A vehicle having two tandem wheels, a minimum of 14 inches in diameter, propelled by human power, upon which a person or persons may ride. A three-wheeled adult tricycle is considered a bicycle. In Oregon, a bicycle is legally defined as a vehicle. Bicyclists have the same right to the roadways and must obey the same traffic laws as the operators of other vehicles.

**Bicycle Boulevard**

See Neighborhood Greenway.

**Bicyclist**

Person riding a bicycle.

**Bike Share**

Bike Share is an innovative transportation program that provides users access to bicycles on a short-term basis for one-way travel within a designated service area.

**Carpool**

A motor vehicle carrying two or three (depending on the context) or more people, usually commuting on a regular or semi-regular basis.

**Car Sharing**

An organization consisting of a group of individuals who share a fleet of cars. The purchase or lease of vehicles, fuel costs, maintenance and repair costs is borne by the organization.

**Centers**

Places with concentrations of commercial and community services, housing, gathering places, and transit connections. Centers provide services to surrounding neighborhoods and are intended to be enhanced as places because they are a focus of housing and job growth. There are four types of centers with varying functions, levels of activity, and scales and intensities of development:

-   Central City: Corresponds to the Central City plan district, which serves as the region's premier center, anchoring an interconnected system of centers.

-   Gateway Regional Center: Corresponds to the Gateway plan district, East Portland's largest center, which is intended to be enhanced as an employment and community service hub within the area and region.

-   Town Centers: Large centers that serve a broad area of the city and have an important role in accommodating growth. They provide a full range of commercial and community services, high-density housing, mid-rise commercial and mid-rise mixed-use buildings (typically up to five to seven stories in height), are served by high-capacity transit connections, and have a substantial employment component. Town Centers provide housing opportunities for enough population to support a full-service business district.

-   Neighborhood Centers: Centers that primarily serve adjacent neighborhoods and provide opportunities for additional housing and low- to mid-rise commercial and mixed-use buildings (typically up to three to five stories in height). They provide a range of local commercial and community services and transit connections. Neighborhood Centers provide housing opportunities for about half the population needed to support a neighborhood business district.

**City Greenway**

A system of distinctive pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly green streets and trails, enhanced by lush tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that support active living by expanding transportation and recreational opportunities and making it easier and more attractive to reach destinations across the city. City Greenways are a network that includes the following types of infrastructure:

1.  Enhanced greenway corridors are distinctive green streets with extensive tree canopy and landscaped stormwater facilities that provide connections between major centers, schools, parks, natural areas, and the rivers.

2.  Trails are often located along rivers or through natural areas, providing pedestrian and bicycle connections.

3.  Heritage parkways are iconic streets or segments of streets with elements such as linear parkways, scenic views, and distinctive landscaping or street design.

4.  Neighborhood greenways are an extensive network of streets with low volumes of motor vehicle traffic that are prioritized for bicycles and enhanced for pedestrians, working in conjunction with the rest of the City Greenways system to extend the system into all neighborhoods.

**Collector of Regional Significance**

As designated in the 2000 Regional Transportation Plan, a route that connects the regional arterial system and the local system by collecting and distributing neighborhood traffic to arterial streets. Collectors of regional significance have three purposes: 1) They ensure adequate access to the primary and secondary land use components of the 2040 Growth Concept; 2) They allow dispersion of arterial traffic over a number of lesser facilities where an adequate local network exists; 3) They help define appropriate collector level movement between jurisdictions. (Source: 2000 RTP)

**Collector Street**

A class of street. Collector streets provide both access and circulation between residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural community areas and the arterial system. As such, collectors tend to carry fewer motor vehicles than arterial streets, with reduced travel speeds. Collector streets are usually spaced at half-mile intervals, midway between arterial streets. Collectors may serve as bike, pedestrian and freight access routes, providing local connections to the arterial street network and transit system. While the focus for collectors has been on motor vehicle traffic, they are developed as multi-modal facilities that accommodate bicycles, pedestrians and transit.

**Complete Streets**

Complete streets provide accessibility to all users of the right-of-way regardless of age, ability, or mode of transportation. They are designed and operated to make better places and to enhance safe access for all modes, including people walking and bicycling, those using a mobility device, motorists, and transit users.

**Community Uses**

Community uses in the right of way include but are not limited to temporary uses such as public gathering spaces, events, food production or temporary festivals, etc.

**Congestion**

A condition characterized by unstable traffic flows that prevents reliable movement on a transportation facility.

**Connected Vehicle**

A vehicle that communicates with the Internet, other vehicles, wayside systems and/or passengers.

**Corridor**

1\. Corridors (2040 design type) -- A type of land use that is typically located along regional transit routes and arterial streets, providing a place for somewhat higher densities than is found in 2040 centers. These land uses should feature a high-quality pedestrian environment and convenient access to transit. Typical new developments would include rowhouses, duplexes and one to three-story office and retail buildings, and average about 25 persons per acre. While some corridors may be continuous, narrow bands of higher-intensity development along arterial streets, others may be more nodal, that is a series of smaller centers at major intersections or other locations along the arterial that have high quality pedestrian environments, good connection to adjacent neighborhoods and transit service.

2\. Corridor as defined in the Comprehensive Plan is an area that may be a single major street, or a broad mobility corridor that provides connections for a range of transportation modes (transit, pedestrians, cyclists, freight, motor vehicles, and so forth), not necessarily on the same street. There are three types of corridor:

-   Civic Corridor: These are a prioritized subset of the city's most prominent transit and transportation streets. They connect centers, provide regional connections, and include segments where commercial development and housing are focused. Civic Corridors are intended to continue their important transportation functions while providing livable environments for people, and evolving into distinctive places that are models of ecological design.

-   Neighborhood Corridor: Main streets that connect neighborhoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They support neighborhood business districts and provide housing opportunities close to local services, amenities, and transit lines. They are streets that include a mix of commercial and higher-density housing development. They have less intense development and transportation function than Civic Corridors.

-   Freight Corridor: Primary routes into and through the city that support Portland as an important West Coast hub and a gateway for international and domestic trade. These facilities are integral to the growth of traded sector businesses such as manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution industries.

**Curb Zone**

The area of public right-of-way adjacent to the curb that can be used for a wide variety of mobility and access functions, including but not limited to vehicle lanes, bike lanes, curb extensions, transit platforms, street trees, loading zones, on-street parking, bike corrals, and street seats.

**Early Bird Parking**

Parking that is provided to encourage its use primarily by commuters. Typically, the pricing strategy is to offer a lower all-day rate if the parker arrives before a certain time in the morning.

**Electric Vehicle**

An electric vehicle (EV), also referred to as an electric drive vehicle, is a vehicle which uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Depending on the type of vehicle, motion may be provided by wheels or propellers driven by rotary motors, or in the case of tracked vehicles, by linear motors.

**Emergency Response Vehicles**

Vehicles employed in responding to emergencies. Examples of emergency response vehicles include fire apparatus, ambulances, and police cars.

**Employer Commute Options (ECO)**

**Goals**

The broadest expressions of a community's desires. Goals give direction and are concerned with the long term; they often describe ideal situations.

**Goods**

Finished products, commodities, and wares ready for the final consumer.

**Green Infrastructure**

Public or private assets --- either natural resources or engineered green facilities --- that protect, support, or mimic natural systems to provide stormwater management, water quality, public health and safety, open space, and other complementary ecosystem services. Examples include trees, ecoroofs, green street facilities, wetlands, and natural waterways.

**Green Street**

A green street is a street with a landscaped street-side planter or bioswale that captures stormwater runoff from the street and allows it to soak into the ground as soil and vegetation filter out pollutants. A green street is not the same as a City Greenway, though a City Greenway may include green street elements.

**High-capacity Transit**

High-capacity transit is public transit that bypasses congestion by making full or partial use of exclusive right of way, a non-exclusive right of way, using transit priority or a combination of both. Vehicles make fewer stops, travel at higher speeds, have more frequent service, and carry more people than local service transit such as typical bus lines. High-capacity transit can be provided by a variety of vehicle types including light rail, commuter rail, streetcar, and bus.

**High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)**

Any vehicle carrying two or more persons, including the driver. An HOV could be a transit bus, vanpool, carpool, or any other vehicle that meets the minimum occupancy requirements. Consistent with federal regulations, motorcycles (with or without passengers) are considered HOVs.

It is governed by a seven-member elected Metro Council and is responsible for regional transportation planning activities, such as the preparation of the 2000 Regional Transportation Plan and the planning of regional transportation projects, including light rail.

**Mixed-Use Areas**

Compact areas of development that include a mix of uses, either within buildings or among buildings, and include residential development as one of the potential components.

**Mobility Zone**

The area of the right-of-way used primarily for people and/or goods movement.

**Multimodal Mixed-Use Area (MMA)**

The Multimodal Mixed-Use Area (MMA) is an ODOT designation applied by local governments to downtowns, town centers, main streets or other areas inside Urban Growth Boundaries where the local government determines there is: high quality connectivity to and within the area by modes of transportation other than the automobile; a denser level of development of a variety of commercial and residential uses than the surrounding areas; a desire to encourage these characteristics through development standards and an understanding that increased automobile congestion within and around the MMA is accepted as a potential trade-off.

**Mobility**

The ability to move people and goods from place to place, or the potential for movement. Mobility improves when the transportation network is refined or expanded to improve capacity of one or more modes, allowing people and goods to move more quickly toward a destination.

**Mode Split**

The percentage of trips taken by each of the possible modes of travel (motor vehicle, transit, bicycle, walk). Mode split does not refer to the number of trips. For example, the number of trips by a particular mode may increase, but the percentage of trips by that mode may stay the same or be reduced if there is also growth in the overall number of trips for other modes.

**Motor Vehicle Level-of-Service (LOS)**

A qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream. A level-of-service definition generally describes these conditions in terms of such factors as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort, convenience, and safety. LOS ratings of 'A' through 'F' describe the traffic flow characteristics on streets and highways and at intersections, as shown on the following table:

**National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQs)**

Air quality standards for a variety of pollutants.

**Neighborhood**

For the TSP classification system, a neighborhood is an area bounded by Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, and/or Neighborhood Collectors.

**Neighborhood Greenway**

Neighborhood greenways are an extensive network of streets with low volumes of motor vehicle traffic that are prioritized for bicycles and enhanced for pedestrians, working in conjunction with the rest of the City Greenways system to extend the system into all neighborhoods.

**Neighborhood Corridor**

Main streets that connect neighborhoods with each other and to other parts of the city. They support neighborhood business districts and provide housing opportunities close to local services, amenities, and transit lines. They are streets that include a mix of commercial and higher-density housing development. They have less intense development and transportation function than Civic Corridors.

Locally adopted comprehensive plans and regional transportation plans must be consistent with the statewide planning goals.

**Paratransit**

On-demand non-fixed route service that serves special transit markets, including disabled populations unable to use regular transit service. Other examples include demand-responsive (e.g., dial-a-ride) and contracted fixed-route service.

**Park-and-Ride Facility**

A parking lot or structure in association with a light rail station, transit stop, or transit transfer point. Generally, park-and-rides should provide access to regional route service for areas not directly served by transit. Bicycle and pedestrian access, as well as parking and storage for bicycles, should be considered in locating new park-and-ride facilities.

**Pattern Areas**

Five primary geographies in Portland that have differing physical characteristics, needs, and assets. Each of these areas has unique topographies and natural features, patterns and types of development, street and other infrastructure characteristics, and histories that have shaped their urban form. The five primary Pattern Areas are:

-   Central City: This area corresponds to the Central City plan district and is also a major center.

-   Inner Neighborhoods: This area includes inner portions of the city that originally developed during the streetcar era, prior to World War II. It includes a large part of the city east of the Willamette River, extending roughly to 82nd Avenue, and also the inner westside "flats," located between the river and the West Hills.

-   Western Neighborhoods: This area includes the West Hills (Tualatin Mountains) and areas to the west.

-   Eastern Neighborhoods: This area includes eastern portions of the city, mostly located east of 82nd Avenue and largely annexed to Portland in the 1980s and 1990s.

-   River: This area includes the land along the Willamette and Columbia Rivers and the Columbia Slough.

**Peak Period**

**Port of Portland**

A public agency that owns and maintains five marine terminals, four airports, and seven business parks in the three-county area. The Port is governed by a nine-member commission appointed by the governor.

**Protected Bike Lane**

Bicycle lanes that are physically separated from motor vehicle and pedestrian travel. A protected bike lane is an exclusive bicycle facility that combines the user experience of a separated path with the on-street infrastructure of a conventional bike lane. A protected bike lane is physically separated from motor traffic and distinct from the sidewalk, using vertical elements such as physical curbs or flexible delineators.

**Public Facility**

Any facility, including buildings, property, and capital assets, that is owned, leased, or otherwise operated, or funded by a governmental body or public entity. Examples of public facilities include sewage treatment and collection facilities, stormwater and flood management facilities, water supply and distribution facilities, streets, and other transportation assets, parks, and public buildings. See also Infrastructure.

**Refinement Plans**

**State Implementation Plan (SIP)**

State plan for achieving air quality goals to ensure compliance with the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.

**Speed Cushion**

Speed cushions are either speed humps or speed tables that include wheel cutouts to allow large vehicles to pass unaffected, while reducing passenger car speeds. They can be offset to allow unimpeded passage by emergency vehicles and are typically used on key emergency response routes. Speed cushions extend across one direction of travel from the centerline, with longitudinal gap provided to allow wide wheel base vehicles to avoid going over the hump.

**Traffic Calming**

Roadway design strategies to reduce vehicle speeds and volumes, prevent inappropriate through traffic and reduce motor vehicle travel speeds while also aimed at improving traffic safety and neighborhood livability. Traffic calming strategies provide speed bumps, curb extensions, planted median strips or round and narrowed travel lanes.

**Trails**

Designated routes on land or water that provide public access for recreation or transportation purposes, like walking and bicycling. Trails are often located along rivers, through natural areas, or along rail or highway rights-of-way, with connections to and through neighborhoods.

**Transit Center**

**Transit-Oriented Development**

A mix of residential, retail, office, and other uses and a supporting network of streets, bikeways, and pedestrianways oriented to a light rail station or transit service and the pedestrian network. Transit-oriented development should include high-density residential development near transit service to support the neighborhood commercial uses and have a lower demand for parking than auto-oriented land uses.

**Transit station areas**

Areas within a half-mile of light rail and other high-capacity transit stations. Some transit station areas are located within centers or civic corridors and are subject to policies for those types of places.

**Transportation Demand Management (TDM)**

Actions taken to change travel behavior in order to improve the performance of transportation facilities, reduce the need for additional road capacity, and reduce impacts on residential neighborhoods. Examples include encouraging the use of alternatives to single-occupant vehicles (SOVs), ridesharing and vanpools, parking management, and trip-reduction ordinances.

**Transportation Planning Rule (TPR)**

The implementing rule of Statewide Planning Goal 12 dealing with transportation, as adopted by the State Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC). Among its provisions, the TPR requires reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 15 percent in the next 30 years, reducing parking spaces per capita by 10 percent in the next 20 years, and improving opportunities for alternatives to the automobile.

**Transportation System Management (TSM)**

Strategies and techniques for increasing the efficiency, safety, or level-of-service of a transportation facility without increasing its size. Examples include, but are not limited to, traffic signal improvements, traffic control devices (including installing medians, channelization, access management, and ramp metering), incident response, targeted traffic enforcement, preferential transit measures, and restriping for high-occupancy vehicle lanes.

**Transportation System Plan (TSP)**

A plan for one or more transportation facilities that are planned, developed, operated, and maintained in a coordinated manner to supply continuity of movement between modes and within and between geographical and jurisdictional areas.

**TriMet**

Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District, the transit agency for most of Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington Counties.

**Trip**

A journey made by any mode between an origin and a destination. Trips can be categorized as follows:

-   Regional trip -- A trip that has neither trip origin nor destination within the Portland metro area.

-   Interregional trip -- A trip that has one trip end within the Portland region and the other trip end outside the Portland region.

-   Interdistrict trip -- A trip that starts in one Transportation District and ends in another\
    > Transportation District.

**Trip End**

The origin or destination point of a journey.

**Urban Growth Management Functional Plan (UGMFP)**

A regional functional plan with requirements binding on cities and counties in the Metro region, as mandated by Metro's Regional Framework Plan. The plan addresses accommodation of projected regional population and job growth, regional parking management, water quality conservation, and limits on retail uses in employment and industrial areas.

**Volume-to-capacity (v/c) Ratio**

A measure of potential roadway capacity. A ratio expressing the relationship between the existing or anticipated volume of traffic on a roadway and the designed capacity of the facility.

**Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) per Capita**

Miles driven in automobiles per person on average. The Transportation Planning Rule requires a 10 percent reduction of VMT per capita within 20 years of adoption of a Transportation System Plan, and an additional 5 percent reduction within 30 years of adoption of the TSP. The VMT per capita reductions mean that individuals will, on average, travel less by automobile than previously but, because the population will continue to grow, it does not mean an overall reduction in the amount of miles driven.
