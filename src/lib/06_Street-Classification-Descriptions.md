Street Classification Descriptions
==================================

Pedestrian Classification Descriptions *(adopted 2002, currently under review. See the update of the [[Pedestrian Master Plan]{.underline}](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/document-library/citywide-plans/modal-plans/pedestrian-master-plan))*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pedestrian Classification Descriptions maintain a system of pedestrianways to serve all types of pedestrian trips, particularly those with a transportation function.

### Pedestrian Districts

Pedestrian Districts are intended to give priority to pedestrian access in areas where high levels of pedestrian activity exist or are planned, including the Central City, Gateway regional center, town centers, and station communities.

> **Land Use:** Zoning should allow a transit-supportive density of residential and commercial uses that support lively and intensive pedestrian activity. Auto- oriented development should be discouraged in Pedestrian Districts. Institutional campuses that generate high levels of pedestrian activity may be included in Pedestrian Districts. Exceptions to the density and zoning criteria may be appropriate in some designated historic districts with a strong pedestrian orientation.
>
> **Streets within a District:** Make walking the mode of choice for all trips within a Pedestrian District. All streets within a Pedestrian District are equal in importance in serving pedestrian trips and should have sidewalks on both sides.
>
> **Characteristics:** The size and configuration of a Pedestrian District should be consistent with the scale of walking trips. A Pedestrian District includes both sides of the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway. In these instances, the land up to the Regional Trafficway is considered part of the Pedestrian District, but the Regional Trafficway itself is not.
>
> **Access to Transit:** A Pedestrian District should have, or be planned to have, frequent transit service and convenient access to transit stops.
>
> **Improvements:** Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design streets within Pedestrian Districts. Improvements may include widened sidewalks, curb extensions, street lighting, street trees, and signing. Where two arterials cross, design treatments such as curb extensions, median pedestrian refuges, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals should be considered to minimize the crossing distance, direct pedestrians across the safest route, and provide safe gaps in the traffic stream.

### Pedestrian-Transit Streets

Pedestrian-Transit Streets are intended to create a strong and visible relationship between pedestrians and transit within the Central City.

> **Land Use:** Pedestrian-Transit Streets respond to significant public investments in public transportation, including light rail, the transit mall, and streetcar, and enhance the pedestrian environment adjacent to high-density land uses.
>
> **Improvements:** Improvements should include wide sidewalks to accommodate high levels of pedestrian traffic, urban design features that promote pedestrian activity, and visual signals to motor vehicles to recognize the priority of pedestrian and transit vehicles.

### City Walkways

City Walkways are intended to provide safe, convenient, and attractive pedestrian access to activities along major streets and to recreation and institutions; provide connections between neighborhoods; and provide access to transit.

> **Land Use:** City Walkways should serve areas with dense zoning, commercial areas, and major destinations. Where auto-oriented land uses are allowed on City Walkways, site development standards should address the needs of pedestrians for access.
>
> **Improvements:** Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design City Walkways. Consider special design treatment for City Walkways that are also designated as Regional or Community Main Streets.

### Off-Street Paths

Off-Street Paths are intended to serve recreational and other walking trips.

> **Function:** Use Off-Street Paths as shortcuts to link urban destinations and origins along continuous greenbelts such as rivers, park and forest areas, and other scenic corridors, and used as elements of a regional, citywide, or community recreational trail plan.
>
> **Location:** Establish Off-Street Paths in corridors not well served by the street system. On existing rights-of-way that are not developed or likely to be developed in the near future, Off-Street Paths may be designated where needed to complete the pedestrian system.
>
> **Improvements:** Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Off-Street Paths. Design Off-Street Paths as separated facilities that accommodate pedestrians and may accommodate other non-motorized vehicles.

### Local Service Walkways

Local Service Walkways are intended to serve local circulation needs for pedestrians and provide safe and convenient access to local destinations, including safe routes to schools.

> **Land Use:** Local Service Walkways are usually located in residential, commercial, or industrial areas on Local Service Traffic Streets.
>
> **Classification:** All streets not classified as City Walkways or Off-Street Paths, with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Walkways.
>
> **Improvements:** Use the Pedestrian Design Guide to design Local Service Walkways.

Bicycle Classification Descriptions
-----------------------------------

### Major City Bikeways

Major City Bikeways form the backbone of the city's bikeway network and are intended to serve high volumes of bicycle traffic and provide direct, seamless, efficient travel across and between transportation districts.

> **Land Use:** Major City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types.
>
> **Improvements:** Major City Bikeways should be designed to accommodate large volumes of bicyclists, to maximize their comfort and to minimize delays by emphasizing the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on Major City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after performing careful analysis to determine potential impacts to the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On Major City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines. Where conditions warrant and where practical, Major City Bikeways should have separated facilities for bicycles and pedestrians.

### 

### City Bikeways

City Bikeways are intended to establish direct and convenient bicycle access to significant destinations, to provide convenient access to Major City Bikeways and to provide coverage within three city blocks of any given point.

> **Land Use:** City Bikeways should support 2040 land use types and residential neighborhoods.
>
> **Improvements:** City Bikeways emphasize the movement of bicycles. Build the highest quality bikeway facilities. Motor vehicle lanes and on-street parking may be removed on City Bikeways to provide needed width for separated-in-roadway facilities where compatible with adjacent land uses and only after taking into consideration the essential movement of all modes. Where improvements to the bicycling environment are needed but the ability to reallocate road space is limited, consider alternative approaches that include property acquisition, or dedication, parallel routes and/or less desirable facilities. On City Bikeways developed as shared roadways, use all appropriate tools to achieve recommended performance guidelines.

### Local Service Bikeways

Local Service Bikeways are intended to serve local circulation needs for bicyclists and provide access to adjacent properties.

> **Classification:** All streets not classified as City Bikeways or Major City Bikeways with the exception of Regional Trafficways not also classified as Major City Traffic Streets, are classified as Local Service Bikeways.
>
> **Improvements:** Consider the following design treatments for Local Service Bikeways: shared roadways, traffic calming, bicycle lanes, and extra-wide curb lanes. Crossings of Local Service Bikeways with other rights-of-way should minimize conflicts.
>
> **On-Street Parking:** On-street parking on Local Service Bikeways should not be removed to provide bicycle lanes.
>
> **Operation:** Treatment of Local Service Bikeways should not have a side effect of creating, accommodating, or encouraging automobile through-traffic.

### Bicycle Districts

Bicycle Districts are areas with a dense concentration of commercial, cultural, institutional and/or recreational destinations where the City intends to make bicycle travel more attractive than driving.

> **Land Use:** High density and mixed-use neighborhoods should be targeted as bicycle districts. Auto-oriented development should be discouraged in Bicycle Districts.
>
> **Characteristics:** The size and configuration of a Bicycle District should be consistent with the scale of bicycling trips. A Bicycle District includes the streets along its boundaries, except where the abutting street is classified as a Regional Trafficway.
>
> **Improvements:** All streets within a Bicycle District are important in serving bicycle trips. Appropriate bicycle facilities should be determined for each street based on the desired bicycling conditions and operations. Use the bikeway design and engineering guidelines to design streets within Bicycle Districts.

Transit Classification Descriptions
-----------------------------------

Maintain a system of transit streets that supports the movement of transit vehicles for regional, interdistrict, and local trips.

### Regional Transitways

Regional Transitways are intended to facilitate regional and interdistrict transit trips with fast and reliable service over long distances, operating in right-of-way exclusively reserved for transit use to the extent possible.

> **Land Use:** Development with a regional attraction (e.g., shopping centers, arenas) are encouraged to locate adjacent to Regional Transitway stations to reduce traffic impacts on adjoining areas and streets. Locate high-density development within a half-mile of transit stations on Regional Transitways, with the highest densities closest to the stations.
>
> **Access to Transit:** Transit stations should be designed to accommodate a high level of safe multimodal access within a half-mile radius of the station. Provide convenient connection opportunities at Regional Transitway stations when feasible, including feeder bus service, bike-share stations, secure bicycle parking, pick-up and drop-off zones, and shuttle services. Use park-and-ride facilities to access Regional Transit stations only at ends of Regional Transitways or where adequate feeder bus service is not feasible.
>
> **Improvements:** Use transit-preferential treatments to facilitate fast and reliable transit operations. Provide signal preemption or transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stations or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Provide exclusive or semi-exclusive transitways wherever possible, including treatments on freeways and expressways such as transit lanes, HOV lanes, HOT lanes, and "bus on shoulder" operations. Employ access management measures to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles. Right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures and improve access to transit. Carefully consider any street design changes to Regional Transitways that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.
>
> **Transit Stations:** Locate Regional Transitway stations at intervals of approximately one-half mile to two miles, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points, and people with disabilities. Express or limited service may have stations located further apart, as appropriate to serve origins and destinations. Transit stations should have a full range of passenger services, including accessible boarding platforms, covered waiting areas, route information, benches, secure bicycle parking, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.\
> \
> **Bus stops:** Buses providing local service along Regional Transitways should have more frequent stop spacing, similar to stop spacing along Major Transit Priority Streets.
>
> **Dual Classification:** A street with a dual Regional Transitway and Major Transit Priority Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major Transit Priority Street and respond to adjacent land uses.
>
> **Connections:** A ramp that connects to a Regional Transitway is classified as a Regional Transitway up to its intersection with a lower-classified street.

### Major Transit Priority Streets

Major Transit Priority Streets facilitate the frequent and reliable movement of transit vehicles that connect Central City, regional centers, and town centers with each other and to other major destinations. Major Transit Priority Streets are provided frequent service, or are expected to receive that level of service in the future to support envisioned growth.

> **Land Use:** Transit-oriented land uses should be encouraged to locate along Major Transit Priority Streets, especially in centers. Discourage auto-oriented develop­ment from locating on a Major Transit Priority Street, except where the street is outside the Central City, center, station community, or main street and is also classified as a Major City Traffic Street. Support land use densi­ties that vary directly with the existing and planned capacity of transit service.
>
> **Access to Transit:** Provide safe and convenient access for pedestrians and bicyclists to, across, and along Major Transit Priority Streets. Provide safe and accessible pedestrian crossings at all transit stops along Major Transit Priority Streets.
>
> **Improvements:** Provide transit signal priority at major intersections, prioritize transit stops or transit lanes over on-street parking, and provide enough lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles. Consider the use of exclusive or semi-exclusive transit lanes where needed to reduce congestion-related transit delay. Design intersections of Major Transit Priority Streets with other Major Transit Priority Streets or Transit Access Streets to allow turning movements of a standard transit vehicle. Where compatible with adjacent land use designations, right-of-way acquisition or parking removal may occur to accommodate transit-preferential measures or improve access to transit. The use of access manage­ment should be considered where needed to reduce conflicts between transit vehicles and other vehicles.Carefully consider any street design changes to Major Transit Priority Streets that impact travel time in light of the potential costs and benefits to transit riders, while also taking into account other adopted goals and policies.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Major Transit Priority Streets are not eligible for new traffic slowing devices such as speed bumps or speed cushions. Existing traffic slowing devices on Major Transit Priority Streets may remain and may be maintained and replaced as needed.
>
> **Transfer Points:** Provide safe and convenient transfer points with accessible stops, covered waiting areas, transit route information, benches, trash receptacles, enhanced signing, lighting, and telephones.
>
> **Bus Stops:** Locate bus stops to provide convenient access to neighborhoods and commercial centers. Stops should be located roughly every one-quarter to one-half mile, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, transfer points and people with disabilities. Stop spacing should also take into account existing sidewalk and street connectivity, with potentially closer stop spacing where sidewalk and street connectivity is more limited. On-street parking should be prohibited at bus stops in order to provide accessible waiting areas. Passenger amenities should include shelters and route information.

### Transit Access Streets

Transit Access Streets facilitate movement of transit vehicles connecting town centers, neighborhood centers, and industrial and employment areas with other destinations and other transit service. Transit Access Streets are provided fixed-route service that is commensurate with the level of demand.

> **Land Use:** Encourage pedestrian- and transit-oriented development in commercial, institutional, and mixed-use areas along Transit Access Streets.
>
> **Access to Transit:** Provide safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access to transfer points and stops and along Transit Access Streets. Provide safe and accessible pedestrian crossings at all transit stops along Transit Access Streets.
>
> **Transfer Points:** Provide bus shelters, safe and convenient pedestrian crossings, and transit information at transfer points.
>
> **Improvements:** Provide transit signal priority as needed at major intersections and prioritize transit stops over on-street parking. Provide sufficient lane width to accommodate standard transit vehicles where appropriate, taking into account other street classifications.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Transit Access Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for traffic slowing devices such as speed bumps or speed cushions. Traffic slowing devices should be designed in accordance with TriMet guidelines.
>
> **Bus Stops:** Stops should be located roughly every one-quarter mile, while taking into account other factors including the need to serve major destinations, activity centers, and transfer points. Stop spacing should also take into account existing sidewalk and street connectivity, with potentially closer stop spacing where sidewalk and street connectivity is more limited. On-street parking should be prohibited at bus stops in order to provide accessible waiting areas. Passenger amenities, including covered waiting areas, are appropriate along Transit Access Streets.

### Local Service Transit Streets

Local Service Transit Streets primarily facilitate movement of smaller transit vehicles, including paratransit and community/jobs connector shuttles. Local Service Transit Streets seldom have regular transit service except for short street segments and do not typically include transit-specific street design elements such as bus stops. Local Service Transit Streets may be used for bus movements to and from a layover facility or bus garage, for turning around at the end of a line, or for temporary reroutes of a fixed-route line.

> **Land Use:** Transit operations on Local Service Transit Streets should give preference to access for individual properties and to the specific needs of property owners and residents along the street.
>
> **Classification:** Streets not classified as Regional Transitways, Major Transit Priority Streets, or Transit Access Streets are classified as Local Service Transit Streets.
>
> **Function:** Local Service Transit Streets may be used for paratransit service, community/jobs connector service, end loops for regularly scheduled routes, or temporary detours, and may carry school buses.
>
> **Bus Stops:** If needed, locate stops along Local Service Transit Streets based on adopted service standards.

### Intercity Passenger Rail

Intercity Passenger Rail provides commuter and other rail passenger service.

> **Station Spacing:** Stations are typically located one or more miles apart, depending on overall route length.

### Passenger Intermodal Facilities

Passenger Intermodal Facilities serve as the hub for various passenger modes and the transfer point between modes.

> **Connections:** Passenger Intermodal Facilities connect inter-urban passenger service with urban public transportation service and are highly accessible by all modes.

Local Service Truck Streets with a higher Traffic classification are the preferred routes for local access and circulation.\
> **Design:** Local Service Truck Streets should give preference to accessing individual properties and the specific needs of property owners and residents along the street. Use of restrictive signage and operational accommodation are appropriate for Local Service Truck Streets.

### Railroad Main Lines

Railroad Main Lines transport freight cargo and passengers over long distances as part of a railway network.

### Railroad Branch Lines

Railroad Branch Lines transport freight cargo over short distances on local rail lines that are not part of a rail network and distribute cargo to and from mail line railroads.

### Freight Facilities

Freight Facilities include the major shipping and marine, air, rail, and pipeline terminals that facilitate the local, national, and international movement of freight.

Street Design Classification Descriptions
-----------------------------------------

Street Design Classification Descriptions provide general design guidance based on the current and planned land use context around the street. Whenever possible, a "complete streets" approach should be taken during street design to accommodate all necessary modes and functions, taking into account the modal classifications. Where right-of-way is limited and tradeoffs must be made, refer to the modal street classifications as well as the Transportation Strategy for People Movement (Policy 9.6) to help guide decision-making regarding allocation of right-of-way. If one or more modes are still unable to be accommodated in the available right-of-way, a "complete networks" approach should be used to ensure that those modes are still accommodated on parallel routes as a part of project design.

>
> **Function:** Urban Throughways primarily serve a mobility function, with little or no local access provided along the street.
>
> **Separation:** Urban Throughways may be completely divided, with no left turns, or they may be mostly divided, with limited opportunities for left turns. Street connections may occur at separated grades, with access controlled by ramps, or there may be limited street connections at grade. If designed as a grade-separated freeway, pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be provided on overpasses or underpasses, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities along the corridor should be provided on parallel pathways. If designed as a limited-access highway or expressway, pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be either grade-separated or signalized, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.
>
> **Design Elements:** Urban Throughway design typically includes vehicle lanes, grade-separated or signalized pedestrian and bicycle, parallel pathways or separated facilities for pedestrian and bicycle travel, clear sightlines, median barriers, shoulders, and motor vehicle lane widths that accommodate freight movement. Where appropriate, transit priority treatments should be used to enhance transit speed and reliability. Encourage the Oregon Department of Transportation to maintain a continuous landscape along Urban Throughways that reduces the visual impacts of the throughway on motorists and adjacent land uses.

> **Connections:** A ramp that connects to an Urban Throughway is classified as an Urban Throughway up to its intersection with a differently-classified street. An interchange between an Urban Throughway and a differently-classified street should be designed to safely accommodate all modes and provide the least possible disruption to the surrounding modal networks. Connections should be provided across Urban Throughways at closely-spaced intervals to provide greater street connectivity.

### Industrial Roads

Industrial Roads are designed to emphasize freight mobility while also accommodating other modes and providing local access.

> **Land Use:** Industrial Roads typically serve industrial areas and freight intermodal sites, with a significant percentage of trips being made by trucks. Adjacent land uses sometimes orient to the Industrial Road.
>
> **Lanes:** Industrial Road design typically includes two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed. Dedicated freight-only lanes or turn pockets may be provided as needed to support roadway efficiency.
>
> **Function:** Industrial Roads emphasize freight mobility while accommodating other modes and providing access to industrial sites and freight districts.
>
> **Curb zone:** The curb zone along Industrial Roads primarily serves mobility functions such as vehicle lanes or bike lanes. The curb zone may be used for access functions such as parking and loading at limited locations if needed to support adjacent land use.
>
> **Separation:** Industrial Roads have limited street connections that may occur at the same grade or separate grades. Pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be grade-separated or signalized, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be separated from motor vehicle traffic.
>
> **Design Elements:** Industrial Road design typically includes vehicle lanes, medians or center turn lanes where needed, limited driveway access, pullouts for bus stops, transit priority treatments, separated pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and improved pedestrian crossings located on overpasses, underpasses, or signalized at-grade intersections. Industrial Roads may also include design treatments that improve freight mobility, such as freight-only lanes, freight signal priority, and a wider turning radius at intersections.

### Enhanced Greenway Corridors

Enhanced Greenway Corridors are designed to provide a network of scenic low-stress connections that prioritize walking and/or bicycling and often include natural features as well as innovative urban design and place-making elements.

> **Dual Classification:** Streets may have an Enhanced Greenway Corridor classification in addition to another street design classification. When developing or retrofitting these streets, incorporate Enhanced Greenway Corridor design elements within the corridor.
>
> **Land Use:** Enhanced Greenway Corridors connect parks, open spaces, and singular attractions throughout the City to each other and to surrounding neighborhoods via a network of scenic and low-stress walking and/or bicycling routes. They can run through a variety of different land use contexts, including residential neighborhoods, natural areas, industrial areas, and employment centers.
>
> **Design Elements:** Enhanced Greenway Corridor design can take many forms, and should use flexible design treatments appropriate to adjacent land use context. Design elements may include: neighborhood greenways; traffic calming; motor vehicle diversion; multi-use paths; wide sidewalks; boardwalks; trails; separated bikeways; broad-canopy trees and landscaping; scenic views; stormwater management; underground utilities; special lighting; and way-finding. Where appropriate, pedestrian and bicycle routes may use separate parallel routes or streets along a corridor.

### Greenscape Streets

Greenscape Street designs are applied to arterials where natural or informal landscapes dominate the adjacent areas and the right-of-way, such as lower-density residential areas in wooded settings.

> **Dual Classification:** Where streets have a Greenscape Street design designation and another street design designation, consider the natural characteristics of the street during the design and implementation of street improvements.
>
> **Design Treatment:** During improvement projects, consider the use of vegetated stormwater treatment techniques; minimizing impervious surfaces; preservation of existing vegetation, topography, vistas and viewpoints, driver perception, street lighting, and sight distance requirements. Vegetation may be landscaped or native, depending on the existing and desired character.

### Local Streets

Local Streets are designed to complement planned land uses and reduce dependence on arterials for local circulation.

> **Land Use:** Local Streets are multimodal, but are not intended for trucks (other than local deliveries) in residential areas. Local Streets are important for local circulation of trucks in commercial and industrial areas.
>
> **Design:** Local Street design typically includes frequent street connections, sidewalks, on-street parking, stormwater facilities, and planting of street trees and ground covers (where planting strips are included). A shared street design without sidewalks may be appropriate where traffic volumes are sufficiently low.
>
> **Classification:** All streets not classified as Urban Throughways, Urban Highways, Industrial Roads, Civic Main Streets, Neighborhood Main Streets, Civic Corridors, Neighborhood Corridors, Regional Corridors, or Community Corridors are classified as Local Streets for street design.

Emergency Response Classification Descriptions
----------------------------------------------

Emergency Response Streets are intended to provide a network of streets to facilitate prompt emergency response.

### Major Emergency Response Streets

Major Emergency Response Streets are intended to serve primarily the longer, most direct legs of emergency response trips.

> **Improvements:** Design treatments on Major Emergency Response Streets should enhance mobility for emergency response vehicles by employing preferential or priority treatments.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Major Emergency Response Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for speed cushions, subject to the approval of Portland Fire and Rescue. Major Emergency Response Streets that also have a District Collector or higher traffic classification are not eligible for traffic slowing devices in the future. Existing speed bumps on Major Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications, subject to the approval of Portland Fire and Rescue. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.

### Secondary Emergency Response Streets

Secondary Emergency Response Streets are intended to provide alternatives to Major Emergency Response Streets in cases when traffic congestion, construction, or other events occur that may cause undue delays in response times.

> **Improvements:** Design treatments on Secondary Emergency Response Streets should enhance mobility for emergency response vehicles by employing preferential or priority treatments, while also allowing for limited traffic slowing treatments to enhance safety and livability.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Secondary Emergency Response Streets that also have a Local Service or Neighborhood Collector traffic classification are eligible for speed cushions. Secondary Emergency Response Streets that also have a District Collector or higher traffic classification are not eligible for traffic slowing devices in the future. Existing speed bumps on Secondary Emergency Response Streets may remain temporarily, and shall be replaced with speed cushions when streets are repaved or undergo other major modifications. Speed cushions should be designed to achieve a similar level of traffic speed reduction as speed bumps.

### Minor Emergency Response Streets

Minor Emergency Response Streets are intended to serve primarily the shorter legs of emergency response trips.

> **Classification:** All streets not classified as Major Emergency Response Streets or Secondary Emergency Response Streets are classified as Minor Emergency Response Streets.
>
> **Improvements:** Design and operate Minor Emergency Response Streets to allow access to individual properties by emergency response vehicles, but maintain livability on the street.
>
> **Traffic Slowing:** Minor Emergency Response Streets are eligible for all types of traffic slowing devices.

Traffic Classification Descriptions
-----------------------------------

Maintain a system of traffic streets that support the movement of motor vehicles for regional, city, district, neighborhood, and local trips. For each type of traffic classification, the majority of motor vehicle trips on a street should conform to its classification description.

### Regional Trafficways

Regional Trafficways are intended to serve regional traffic movement that has only one trip end in a City of Portland transportation district or to serve trips that bypass a district completely.

> **Safety:** Regional Trafficways should make safety the highest priority. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Regional Trafficways to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** Regional Trafficways should serve the Central City, regional centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities and should connect key freight routes within the region to points outside the region.
>
> **Connections:** Regional Trafficways should connect to other Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, and District Collectors. A ramp that connects to a Regional Trafficway is classified as a Regional Trafficway from its point of connection up to its intersection with a lower-classified street. At ramps and along access streets, accommodate safe multimodal movements.
>
> **Buffering:** Adjacent neighborhoods should be buffered from the impacts of Regional Trafficways.
>
> **Dual Classification:** A street with dual Regional Trafficway and Major City Traffic Street classifications should retain the operational characteristics of a Major City Traffic Street and respond to adjacent land uses.

### Major City Traffic Streets

Major City Traffic Streets are intended to serve as the principal routes for interdistrict traffic that has at least one trip end within a City of Portland transportation district.

> **Safety:** Safety should be the highest priority on Major City Traffic Streets. Safety countermeasures should be employed on Major City Traffic Streets to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes for all modes. Major City Traffic Streets should provide separation between motor vehicles and people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices, and provide safe multimodal crossings to destinations.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** Major City Traffic Streets should provide motor vehicle connections among the Central City, regional centers, town centers, industrial areas, and intermodal facilities. Auto-oriented development should locate adjacent to Major City Traffic Streets, except within designated centers, main streets, station areas, and other areas with high pedestrian demand.
>
> **Connections:** Major City Traffic Streets should serve as primary connections to Regional Trafficways and serve major activity centers in each district. Traffic with no trip ends within a City of Portland transportation district should be discouraged from using Major City Traffic Streets. Where a Major City Traffic Street intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.
>
> **On-Street Parking:** On-street parking may be removed and additional right-of-way purchased to provide adequate traffic access when consistent with the street design designation of the street. Evaluate the need for on-street parking to serve adjacent land uses and improve the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists when making changes to the roadway.

### Traffic Access Streets

Traffic Access Streets are intended to provide access to Central City destinations, distribute traffic within a Central City sub-district, provide connections between Central City subdistricts, and distribute traffic from Regional Trafficways and Major City Traffic Streets for access within the district. Traffic Access Streets are not intended for through-traffic with no trip ends in the district.

> **Safety:** Safety should be the highest priority on Traffic Access Streets. Traffic Access Streets should provide frequent, safe crossings for people walking, bicycling, and using mobility devices.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** Traffic Access Streets serve Central City land uses. Traffic management on Traffic Access Streets must accommodate the high-density pattern desired in the Central City.
>
> **Connections:** Connections to adjoining transportation districts should be to District or Neighborhood Collectors. Intersections of Traffic Access Streets and other streets with higher or similar classifications should be signalized, where warranted, to facilitate the safe movement of traffic along each street as well as turning movements from one street to the other.
>
> **Access:** Reduction in motor vehicle congestion is given less priority than: supporting pedestrian access and enhancing the pedestrian environment; maintaining on-street parking to support land uses; accommodating transit; or accommodating bicycles. Access to off-street parking is allowed and encouraged to be located on Traffic Access Streets.
>
> **Right-of-way acquisition:** Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Traffic Access Streets, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.

### District Collectors

District Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets to streets of the same or lower classification or to serve trips that both start and end within a district.

> **Safety:** Safety should be the highest priority on District Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be employed to address identified safety risks with a focus on eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** District Collectors generally connect town centers, corridors, main streets, and neighborhoods to nearby regional centers and other major destinations. Land uses that attract trips from the surrounding neighbor­hoods or from throughout the district should be encouraged to locate on District Collectors. Regional attractors of traffic such as major shopping centers or arenas should be discouraged from locating on District Collectors.
>
> **Connections:** District Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, other collectors, and local streets and, where necessary, to Regional Trafficways. Where a District Collector intersects with a Neighborhood Collector or Local Service Traffic Street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.
>
> **Right-of-way acquisition:** Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on District Collectors, except at specific problem locations to accommodate traffic movement and vehicle access to abutting properties.

### Neighborhood Collectors

Neighborhood Collectors are intended to serve as distributors of traffic from Major City Traffic Streets or District Collectors to Local Service Streets or to serve trips that both start and end within areas bounded by Major City Traffic Streets and District Collectors.

> **Safety:** Safety should be the highest priority on Neighborhood Collectors. Safety countermeasures should be implemented on Neighborhood Collectors to address identified safety risks. Neighborhood Collectors should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** Neighborhood Collectors should connect neighborhoods to nearby centers, corridors, station communities, main streets, and other nearby destinations. New land uses and major expansions of land uses that attract a significant volume of traffic from outside the neighborhood should be discour­aged from locating on Neighborhood Collectors.
>
> **Connections:** Neighborhood Collectors should connect to Major City Traffic Streets, District Collectors, and other Neighborhood Collectors, as well as to Local Service Streets. Where a Neighborhood Collector intersects with a higher-classified street, access management and/or turn restrictions may be employed to reduce traffic delay.
>
> **Traffic Calming:** Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability, when consistent with other street classifications.
>
> **Function:** The design of Neighborhood Collectors may vary over their length as the land use character changes from primarily commercial to primarily residential. All Neighborhood Collectors should be designed to operate as neighborhood streets and through traffic should be discouraged.
>
> **Right-of-way acquisition:** Right-of-way acquisition should be discouraged on Neighborhood Collectors.

### Local Service Traffic Streets

Local Service Traffic Streets are intended to distribute local traffic and provide access to local residences or commercial uses.

> **Safety:** Local Service Traffic Streets should maintain slow vehicle operating speeds to accommodate safe use by all modes.
>
> **Land Use/Development:** Discourage auto-oriented land uses from using Local Service Traffic Streets as their primary access.
>
> **Classification:** Streets that allow motor vehicles and are not classified as Regional Trafficways, Major City Traffic Streets, Traffic Access Streets**,** District Collectors, or Neighborhood Collectors are classified as Local Service Traffic Streets.
>
> **Connections:** Local Service Traffic Streets should connect neighborhoods, provide local circulation, and provide access to nearby centers, corridors, station areas, and main streets. Street segments may be closed to through traffic in some cases as long as local access and overall neighborhood connectivity is maintained.
>
> **Traffic Calming:** Traffic calming tools and traffic slowing devices may be used to improve neighborhood safety and livability or if needed to support a neighborhood greenway.
>
> **Function:** Local Service Traffic Streets provide local access and circulation for traffic, while often functioning as through routes for pedestrians and bicyclists. In some instances where vehicle speeds and volumes are very low, Local Service Traffic Streets may accommodate vehicles**,** pedestrians**,** and bicyclists in a shared space.
