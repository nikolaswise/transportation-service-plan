Transportation Goals 
=====================

(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 9)

### Safety

The City achieves the standard of zero traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries. Transportation safety impacts the livability of a city and the comfort and security of those using City streets. Comprehensive efforts to improve transportation safety through equity, engineering, education, enforcement and evaluation will be used to eliminate traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries from Portland's transportation system. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.A)

### Multiple goals

Portland's transportation system is funded and maintained to achieve multiple goals and measurable outcomes for people and the environment. The transportation system is safe, complete, interconnected, multimodal, and fulfills daily needs for people and businesses. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.B)

### Great places

Portland's transportation system enhances quality of life for all Portlanders, reinforces existing neighborhoods and great places, and helps make new great places in town centers, neighborhood centers and corridors, and civic corridors. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.C)

### Environmentally sustainable

The transportation system increasingly uses active transportation, renewable energy, or electricity from renewable sources, achieves adopted carbon reduction targets, and reduces air pollution, water pollution, noise, and Portlanders' reliance on private vehicles. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.D)

### Equitable transportation

The transportation system provides all Portlanders options to move about the city and meet their daily needs by using a variety of safe, efficient, convenient, and affordable modes of transportation. Transportation investments are responsive to the distinct needs of each community. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.E)

### Positive health outcomes

The transportation system promotes positive health outcomes and minimizes negative impacts for all Portlanders by supporting active transportation, physical activity, and community and individual health. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.F)

### Opportunities for prosperity

The transportation system supports a strong and diverse economy, enhances the competitiveness of the city and region, and maintains Portland's role as a West Coast trade gateway and freight hub by providing efficient and reliable goods movement, multimodal access to employment areas and educational institutions, as well as enhanced freight access to industrial areas and intermodal freight facilities. The transportation system helps people and businesses reduce spending and keep money in the local economy by providing affordable alternatives to driving. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.G)

### Cost effectiveness

The City analyzes and prioritizes capital and operating investments to cost effectively achieve the above goals while responsibly managing and protecting our past investments in existing assets. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.H)

### Airport futures

Promote a sustainable airport (Portland International Airport \[PDX\]) by meeting the region's air transportation needs without compromising livability and quality of life for future generations. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 9.I)

**Use of classifications:** Plan, develop, implement, and manage the transportation system in accordance with street design and policy classifications outlined in the Transportation System Plan. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 9.4)

> **a:** Classification descriptions are used to describe how streets should function for each mode of travel, not necessarily how they are functioning at present. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 9.4.a)

**Mode share goals and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reduction:** Increase the share of trips made using active and low-carbon transportation modes. Reduce VMT to achieve targets set in the most current Climate Action Plan and Transportation System Plan, and meet or exceed Metro's mode share and VMT targets. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 9.5)

1.  Walking

2.  Bicycling

3.  Transit

4.  Fleets of electric, fully automated, multiple passenger vehicles

5.  Other shared vehicles

6.  Low or no occupancy vehicles, fossil-fueled non-transit vehicles

4.  Supporting and encouraging use of public transportation (Transportation System Plan Policy Policy 9.68.b)

> **c.** Cut vehicle carbon pollution by reducing low occupancy "empty miles" traveled by passenger vehicles with zero or one passengers. Prioritize electric and other zero direct emission vehicles operated by fleets and carrying multiple passengers. (Transportation System Plan Policy Policy 9.68.c)
>
> **d.** Make the benefits of automated mobility available on an equitable basis to all segments of the community while ensuring traditionally disadvantaged communities are not disproportionately hurt by connected and autonomous vehicle use. This includes people with disabilities, as well as communities of color, women, and geographically underserved communities. (Transportation System Plan Policy Policy 9.68.d)
>
> **e**. Identify, prevent, identify, and mitigate potential adverse impacts from connected and automated vehicles. (Transportation System Plan Policy Policy 9.68.e)

**Connected and automated vehicles tools:** Use a full range of tools to ensure that connected and automated vehicles and private data communications devices installed in the City right of way contribute to achieving Comprehensive Plan and Transportation System Plan goals and policies. (Transportation System PlanPolicy 9.69)

> **a:** Maintain City authority to identify and develop appropriate data sharing requirements to inform and support safe, efficient, and effective management of the transportation system. Ensure that when connected and automated vehicles use City rights-of-way or when vehicles connect with smart infrastructure within the City they share information including, but not limited to, vehicle type, occupancy, speed, travel routes, and travel times, with appropriate privacy controls. Ensure that private data communications devices installed in the City right of way are required to share anonymized transportation data. (Transportation System Plan Policy 9.69.a)
>
> **b:** Design and manage the mobility zone, curb zone, and traffic control devices, e.g. to limit speeds to increase safety, to minimize cut-through traffic, evaluate future demand for pick-up and drop-off zones, and to prioritize automated electric vehicles carrying more passengers in congested times and locations. (Transportation System Plan Policy 9.69.b)
>
> **c:** Evaluate the public cost and benefit of investments in wayside communication systems serving connected and automated vehicles. Develop a criteria-driven automated vehicle wayside infrastructure investment plan. (Transportation System Plan Policy 9.69.c)
>
> **d.** Develop sustainable user-pays funding mechanisms to support connected and automated vehicle infrastructure and service investments, transportation system maintenance, and efficient system management. (Transportation System Plan Policy 9.69.d)
>
> **e.** Ensure that automated vehicles and vehicles that connect to smart City infrastructure, and private data communications devices installed in the City right of way, help pay for infrastructure and service investments, and support system reliability and efficiency. Develop a tiered pricing structure that reflects vehicle impacts on the transportation system, including factors such as congestion level, vehicle miles traveled, vehicle occupancy, and vehicle energy efficiency.
