Encourage stormwater facilities that are designed to be a functional and attractive element of public spaces, especially in centers and corridors. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.4)

**Pedestrian-oriented design:** Enhance the pedestrian experience throughout Portland through public and private development that creates accessible, safe, and attractive places for all those who walk and/or use wheelchairs or other mobility devices. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.5)

**Street orientation:** Promote building and site designs that enhance the pedestrian experience with windows, entrances, pathways, and other features that provide connections to the street environment. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.6)

**Development and public spaces:** Guide development to help create high-quality public places and street environments while considering the role of adjacent development in framing, shaping, and activating the public space of streets and urban parks. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.7)

**Alleys:** Encourage the continued use of alleys for parking access, while preserving pedestrian access. Expand the number of alley-facing accessory dwelling units. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.8)

**Transitional urbanism:** Encourage temporary activities and structures in places that are transitioning to urban areas to promote job creation, entrepreneurship, active streets, and human interaction. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.9)

**Design and Development of Centers and Corridors Policies**

**Walkable scale:** Focus services and higher-density housing in the core of centers to support a critical mass of demand for commercial services and more walkable access for customers. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.20)

**Street environment:** Encourage development in centers and corridors to include amenities that create a pedestrian-oriented environment and provide places for people to sit, spend time, and gather. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.21)

**Relationship between building height and street size:** Encourage development in centers and corridors that is responsive to street space width, thus allowing taller buildings on wider streets. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.22)

**Design for pedestrian and bicycle access:** Provide accessible sidewalks, high-quality bicycle access, and frequent street connections and crossings in centers and corridors. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.23)

**Designing with Nature Policies**

**Design with nature:** Encourage design and site development practices that enhance, and avoid the degradation of, watershed health and ecosystem services and that incorporate trees and vegetation. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.73)

**Flexible development options:** Encourage flexibility in the division of land, the siting and design of buildings, and other improvements to reduce the impact of development on environmentally-sensitive areas and to retain healthy native and beneficial vegetation and trees. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.74)

**Low-impact development and best practices:** Encourage use of low-impact development, habitat-friendly development, bird-friendly design, and green infrastructure. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.75)

**Impervious surfaces:** Limit use of and strive to reduce impervious surfaces and associated impacts on hydrologic function, air and water quality, habitat connectivity, tree canopy, and urban heat island effects. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.76)
