(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 4)

Design and Development Goals
----------------------------

Context-sensitive Design and Development
========================================

New development is designed to respond to and enhance the distinctive physical, historic, and cultural qualities of its location, while accommodating growth and change. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 4.A)

Human and Environmental Health
==============================

Neighborhoods and development are efficiently designed and built to enhance human and environmental health: they protect safety and livability; support local access to healthy food; limit negative impacts on water, hydrology, and air quality; reduce carbon emissions; encourage active and sustainable design; protect wildlife; address urban heat islands; and integrate nature and the built environment. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 4.C)

Design and Development Policies
-------------------------------

Context Policies
================

**Pattern areas:** Encourage building and site designs that respect the unique built natural, historic, and cultural characteristics of Portland's five pattern areas described in Chapter 3: Urban Form. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.1)

**Community identity:** Encourage the development of character-giving design features that are responsive to place and the cultures of communities. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.2)

**Site and context:** Encourage development that responds to and enhances the positive qualities of site and context --- the neighborhood, the block, the public realm, and natural features. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.3)

**Natural features and green infrastructure:** Integrate natural and green infrastructure such as trees, green spaces, ecoroofs, gardens, green walls, and vegetated stormwater management systems, into the urban environment. Encourage stormwater facilities that are designed to be a functional and attractive element of public spaces, especially in centers and corridors. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.4)

**Pedestrian-oriented design:** Enhance the pedestrian experience throughout Portland through public and private development that creates accessible, safe, and attractive places for all those who walk and/or use wheelchairs or other mobility devices. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.5)

**Street orientation:** Promote building and site designs that enhance the pedestrian experience with windows, entrances, pathways, and other features that provide connections to the street environment. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.6)

**Development and public spaces:** Guide development to help create high-quality public places and street environments while considering the role of adjacent development in framing, shaping, and activating the public space of streets and urban parks. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.7)

**Alleys:** Encourage the continued use of alleys for parking access, while preserving pedestrian access. Expand the number of alley-facing accessory dwelling units. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.8)

**Transitional urbanism:** Encourage temporary activities and structures in places that are transitioning to urban areas to promote job creation, entrepreneurship, active streets, and human interaction. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.9)

Design and Development of Centers and Corridors Policies
========================================================

**Walkable scale:** Focus services and higher-density housing in the core of centers to support a critical mass of demand for commercial services and more walkable access for customers. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.20)

**Street environment:** Encourage development in centers and corridors to include amenities that create a pedestrian-oriented environment and provide places for people to sit, spend time, and gather. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.21)

**Relationship between building height and street size:** Encourage development in centers and corridors that is responsive to street space width, thus allowing taller buildings on wider streets. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.22)

**Design for pedestrian and bicycle access:** Provide accessible sidewalks, high-quality bicycle access, and frequent street connections and crossings in centers and corridors. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.23)

Designing with Nature Policies
==============================

**Design with nature:** Encourage design and site development practices that enhance, and avoid the degradation of, watershed health and ecosystem services and that incorporate trees and vegetation. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.73)

**Flexible development options:** Encourage flexibility in the division of land, the siting and design of buildings, and other improvements to reduce the impact of development on environmentally-sensitive areas and to retain healthy native and beneficial vegetation and trees. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.74)

**Low-impact development and best practices:** Encourage use of low-impact development, habitat-friendly development, bird-friendly design, and green infrastructure. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.75)

**Impervious surfaces:** Limit use of and strive to reduce impervious surfaces and associated impacts on hydrologic function, air and water quality, habitat connectivity, tree canopy, and urban heat island effects. (Comprehensive Plan Policy 4.76)
