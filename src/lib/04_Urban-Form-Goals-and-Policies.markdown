Urban Form Goals
================

(Comprehensive Plan Chapter 3)

### A city designed for people 

Portland's built environment is designed to serve the needs and aspirations of all Portlanders, promoting prosperity, health, equity, and resiliency. New development, redevelopment, and public investments reduce disparities and encourage social interaction to create a healthy connected city. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.A)

### A climate and hazard resilient urban form

Portland's compact urban form, sustainable building development practices, green infrastructure, and active transportation system reduce carbon emissions, reduce natural hazard risks and impacts, and improve resilience to the effects of climate change. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.B)

### Focused growth

Household and employment growth is focused in the Central City and other centers, corridors, and transit station areas, creating compact urban development in areas with a high level of service and amenities, while allowing the relative stability of lower-density single-family residential areas. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.C)

### A system of centers and corridors

Portland's interconnected system of centers and corridors provides diverse housing options and employment opportunities, robust multimodal transportation connections, access to local services and amenities, and supports low-carbon complete, healthy, and equitable communities. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.D)

### Connected public realm and open spaces

A network of parks, streets, City Greenways, and other public spaces supports community interaction; connects neighborhoods, districts, and destinations; and improves air, water, land quality, and environmental health. (Comprehensive Plan Goal 3.E)

**Regional transportation hub:** Strengthen the Central City as the highly accessible and multimodal hub for moving people and goods, reinforcing its regional center roles, enabling successful high density employment and housing development, and thereby affirming its role in Metro's Region 2040 Framework Plan. (Central City 2035 TSP Policy 9.40)

**Portals**: Manage entry points into the Central City to provide balanced multimodal access to efficiently accommodate the increase in person trips and goods delivery as a result of growth and development. Discourage through trips from using Central City streets. (Central City 2035 TSP Policy 9.41)

**Optimized street network:**. Improve street design and function to increase efficiency and safety for all transportation modes and the ability of the existing network to meet the access needs of businesses, shoppers, residents and visitors. Establish a system and standards that emphasize walking, bicycling, transit use and freight access while continuing to provide automobile access. (Central City 2035 TSP Policy 9.42)

**Transportation system management:** Manage access and circulation to reduce traffic speeds and provide for safe street crossings, while balancing the need for vehicle and freight access to and from the district. Manage the roadway system within the Central City in a way that allows greater levels of traffic congestion. In congested areas, prioritize modes other than automobiles to accommodate travel demand. (Central City 2035 TSP Policy 9.43)

**Regional multimodal access**: Work with the Oregon Department of Transportation on improvements to I-405, I-5 and US26 to enhance regional access to the Central City.

Pattern Areas 
--------------

Portland has five distinct Pattern Areas. The development patterns and characteristics of these areas are influenced by the natural landscape and how and when these parts of the city were developed.

1.  **Rivers**

2.  **Central City**

3.  **Inner Neighborhoods**

4.  **Western Neighborhoods**

5.  **Eastern Neighborhoods**

Each Pattern Area has unique physical, social, cultural, and environmental qualities that differentiate them and create their sense of place. To maintain and enhance the positive qualities and sense of place in each pattern area, it is desirable to have policies and regulations that respond to each area's unique natural and built assets.
