Transportation Goals (Comp Plan Chapter 9)
==============================================

**Safety (Comp Plan Goal 9.A)\
**The City achieves the standard of zero traffic-related fatalities and
serious injuries. Transportation safety impacts the livability of a city
and the comfort and security of those using City streets. Comprehensive
efforts to improve transportation safety through equity, engineering,
education, enforcement and evaluation will be used to eliminate
traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries from Portland’s
transportation system.

**Multiple goals (Comp Plan Goal 9.B)\
**Portland’s transportation system is funded and maintained to achieve
multiple goals and measureable outcomes for people and the environment.
The transportation system is safe, complete, interconnected, multimodal,
and fulfills daily needs for people and businesses.

**Great places (Comp Plan Goal 9.C)\
**Portland’s transportation system enhances quality of life for all
Portlanders, reinforces existing neighborhoods and great places, and
helps make new great places in town centers, neighborhood centers and
corridors, and civic corridors.

**Environmentally sustainable (Comp Plan Goal 9.D)\
**The transportation system increasingly uses active transportation,
renewable energy, or electricity from renewable sources, achieves
adopted carbon reduction targets, and reduces air pollution, water
pollution, noise, and Portlanders’ reliance on private vehicles.

**Equitable transportation (Comp Plan Goal 9.E)\
**The transportation system provides all Portlanders options to move
about the city and meet their daily needs by using a variety of safe,
efficient, convenient, and affordable modes of transportation.
Transportation investments are responsive to the distinct needs of each
community.

**Positive health outcomes (Comp Plan Goal 9.F)\
**The transportation system promotes positive health outcomes and
minimizes negative impacts for all Portlanders by supporting active
transportation, physical activity, and community and individual health.

**Opportunities for prosperity (Comp Plan Goal 9.G)\
**The transportation system supports a strong and diverse economy,
enhances the competitiveness of the city and region, and maintains
Portland’s role as a West Coast trade gateway and freight hub by
providing efficient and reliable goods movement, multimodal access to
employment areas and educational institutions, as well as enhanced
freight access to industrial areas and intermodal freight facilities.
The transportation system helps people and businesses reduce spending
and keep money in the local economy by providing affordable alternatives
to driving.

**Cost effectiveness (Comp Plan Goal 9.H)\
**The City analyzes and prioritizes capital and operating investments to
cost effectively achieve the above goals while responsibly managing and
protecting our past investments in existing assets.

**Airport futures (Comp Plan Goal 9.I)\
**Promote a sustainable airport (Portland International Airport \[PDX\])
by meeting the region’s air transportation needs without compromising
livability and quality of life for future generations.

**Urban Form Goals (Comp Plan Chapter 3)**

**A city designed for people (Comp Plan Goal 3.A)\

reduce disparities and encourage social interaction to create a healthy
connected city.

**A climate and hazard resilient urban form (Comp Plan Goal 3.B)\
**Portland’s compact urban form, sustainable building development
practices, green infrastructure, and active transportation system reduce
carbon emissions, reduce natural hazard risks and impacts, and improve
resilience to the effects of climate change.

**Focused growth (Comp Plan Goal 3.C)\
**Household and employment growth is focused in the Central City and
other centers, corridors, and transit station areas, creating compact
urban development in areas with a high level of service and amenities,
while allowing the relative stability of lower-density single-family
residential areas.

**A system of centers and corridors (Comp Plan Goal 3.D)\
**Portland’s interconnected system of centers and corridors provides

**Neighborhoods and development are efficiently designed and built to
enhance human and environmental health: they protect safety and
livability; support local access to healthy food; limit negative impacts
on water, hydrology, and air quality; reduce carbon emissions; encourage
active and sustainable design; protect wildlife; address urban heat
islands; and integrate nature and the built environment.
